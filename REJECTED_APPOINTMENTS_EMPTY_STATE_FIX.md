# 🔧 Rejected Appointments Empty State Fix

## Issue

The rejected appointments view was not correctly showing the specific empty state message:

```html
<div class="empty-state">
  <i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i>
  <p>No rejected appointments to review</p>
</div>
```

## Root Cause

The `renderRejectedAppointments` function had flawed logic in determining which data to use:

**Before (❌ BROKEN):**

```javascript
const renderRejectedAppointments = () => {
  const rejectedAppointments =
    currentView === "rejected" && Array.isArray(tabData) ? tabData : [];
  // This would return [] when currentView !== "rejected"
  // even if there was rejected appointment data available
```

## Solution Applied

**File:** `royal-care-frontend/src/components/OperatorDashboard.jsx`

**After (✅ FIXED):**

```javascript
const renderRejectedAppointments = () => {
  // ✅ FIXED: Use rejected appointments query data directly
  const rejectedAppointments = rejectedAppointmentsQuery.data
    ? Array.isArray(rejectedAppointmentsQuery.data)
      ? rejectedAppointmentsQuery.data
      : rejectedAppointmentsQuery.data?.results || []
    : [];

  if (!rejectedAppointments || rejectedAppointments.length === 0) {
    return (
      <div className="empty-state">
        <i className="fas fa-times-circle"></i>
        <p>No rejected appointments to review</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
  // ... rest of the function
```

## Expected Behavior

Now when users navigate to the "Rejected Appointments" tab:

1. **If there are rejected appointments**: Shows the list of rejected appointments with review buttons
2. **If there are no rejected appointments**: Shows the exact empty state message requested:
   ```html
   <div class="empty-state">
     <i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i>
     <p>No rejected appointments to review</p>
   </div>
   ```

## Benefits

- ✅ **Consistent data source**: Uses the same query (`rejectedAppointmentsQuery`) for both data and empty state logic
- ✅ **Proper empty state display**: Shows the specific message with the times-circle icon as requested
- ✅ **Reliable condition**: No longer depends on `currentView` logic that could cause incorrect empty states
- ✅ **Better user experience**: Clear feedback when there are no rejected appointments to review

## Notes

This fix works in conjunction with the previous rejection overview mismatch fix to ensure both the statistics and the detailed view are consistent and accurate.
