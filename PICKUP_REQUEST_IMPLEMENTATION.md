# Pickup Request Implementation - Complete Summary

## Problem Fixed

When a therapist requests a pickup after completing a session, the appointment card was not appearing in the Driver Dashboard's "Today's Transports" for the assigned driver.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Backend Issues**: The backend was trying to set non-existent fields (`pickup_driver`, `assigned_driver`) instead of using the main `driver` field for pickup assignments.
2. **Frontend Filtering**: The DriverDashboard was missing critical pickup-related statuses (`driver_assigned_pickup`, `return_journey`) in its filtering logic.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Fixes (guitara/scheduling/views.py)

#### Fixed Non-existent Field References

- **Before**: Code tried to set `appointment.pickup_driver = available_driver` and `appointment.assigned_driver = available_driver`
- **After**: Uses `appointment.driver = available_driver` (the actual field that exists)

#### Updated Pickup Assignment Logic

```python
# Fixed auto-assignment in request_pickup endpoint
if available_driver:
    appointment.status = "driver_assigned_pickup"
    appointment.driver = available_driver  # Use main driver field
    appointment.save()
```

#### Fixed Authorization Checks

```python
# Fixed pickup confirmation/rejection checks
if request.user != appointment.driver:  # Was: appointment.pickup_driver
    return Response({"error": "You can only confirm pickup assignments assigned to you"})
```

#### Fixed Driver Query References

```python
# Fixed driver detailed info query
last_completed_appointment = Appointment.objects.filter(
    driver=driver,  # Was: assigned_driver=driver
    status__in=["completed", "dropped_off", "therapist_dropped_off"],
)
```

### 2. Frontend Fixes (royal-care-frontend/src/components/DriverDashboard.jsx)

#### Enhanced Appointment Filtering

- **Before**: Missing `driver_assigned_pickup` and `return_journey` statuses
- **After**: Added all pickup-related statuses to visible statuses arrays

```javascript
const visibleStatuses = [
  "pending",
  "therapist_confirmed",
  "driver_confirmed",
  "in_progress",
  "journey_started",
  "journey",
  "arrived",
  "dropped_off",
  "session_in_progress",
  "awaiting_payment",
  "completed",
  "pickup_requested",
  "driver_assigned_pickup", // ✅ Added
  "return_journey", // ✅ Added
];
```

#### Improved Driver Assignment Check

- **Before**: Simple `apt.driver !== user?.id` check
- **After**: Clear assignment check with better debugging

```javascript
const myAppointments = appointments.filter((apt) => {
  const isAssignedDriver = apt.driver === user?.id;
  if (!isAssignedDriver) return false;
  return visibleStatuses.includes(apt.status);
});
```

#### Applied to All Filter Functions

- Updated `myAppointments`, `myTodayAppointments`, `myUpcomingAppointments`, and `myAllTransports` filters
- Ensured consistent filtering logic across all views

## Workflow Verification

### Complete Pickup Request Flow

1. **Session Completion**: Therapist completes session (status: `completed`)
2. **Pickup Request**: Therapist requests pickup (status: `pickup_requested`)
3. **Auto-Assignment**: System tries to auto-assign available driver
4. **Driver Assignment**: Driver assigned for pickup (status: `driver_assigned_pickup`)
5. **Driver Confirmation**: Driver confirms pickup (status: `return_journey`)
6. **Pickup Complete**: Driver completes pickup and transport

### Driver Dashboard Visibility

Now drivers will see pickup assignments in their "Today's Transports" when:

- Status is `pickup_requested` (waiting for assignment)
- Status is `driver_assigned_pickup` (assigned, needs confirmation)
- Status is `return_journey` (confirmed, in progress)

## Testing

Created comprehensive test script (`test_pickup_workflow.py`) that:

- Creates test appointment with completed status
- Simulates pickup request workflow
- Verifies driver can see pickup assignment
- Tests status transitions
- Validates filtering logic

## Files Modified

1. `guitara/scheduling/views.py` - Fixed backend pickup assignment logic
2. `royal-care-frontend/src/components/DriverDashboard.jsx` - Enhanced filtering for pickup requests

## Expected User Experience

1. **Therapist**: Completes session → Requests pickup → Gets confirmation
2. **Driver**: Sees pickup assignment in Dashboard → Can confirm/reject → Proceeds with pickup
3. **Operator**: Can monitor pickup assignments and manually assign if needed

## Key Benefits

- ✅ Pickup requests now appear correctly in Driver Dashboard
- ✅ Fixed backend field assignment errors
- ✅ Improved driver assignment workflow
- ✅ Better visibility of pickup statuses
- ✅ Consistent filtering logic across all dashboard views
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with existing appointments

## Verification Steps

1. Complete a therapy session (mark as `completed`)
2. As therapist, request pickup from TherapistDashboard
3. As driver, check DriverDashboard → Today's Transports
4. Verify pickup assignment appears with correct buttons
5. Test confirm/reject pickup functionality
6. Verify status updates correctly

The implementation ensures that when a therapist requests pickup, the assigned driver will see the appointment card in their Dashboard's "Today's Transports" section with appropriate action buttons for confirming or rejecting the pickup assignment.
