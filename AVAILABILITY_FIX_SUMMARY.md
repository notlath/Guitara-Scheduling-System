# Therapist Availability Filtering - Implementation Summary

## Issue Description
The original problem was that therapist availability filtering was not working correctly. The system would return therapists even when their availability didn't match the selected date and time, and the frontend couldn't display when therapists were available.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Backend**: The `available_therapists` and `available_drivers` endpoints were returning limited data without availability times
2. **Frontend**: The Redux slice was incorrectly handling the response data 
3. **UI**: The interface wasn't displaying availability times to users

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Backend API Updates (`guitara/scheduling/views.py`)

**Modified `available_therapists` method:**
- Added `.select_related().prefetch_related('availabilities')` for efficient querying
- Changed response format from `UserSerializer` to custom objects including:
  - User fields: `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `role`, `specialization`, `massage_pressure`
  - Availability fields: `start_time`, `end_time`, `is_available`, `availability_date`
- Improved filtering logic to ensure only truly available therapists are returned

**Modified `available_drivers` method:**
- Similar changes to therapists endpoint
- Returns driver-specific fields: `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `role`, `motorcycle_plate`
- Plus availability fields: `start_time`, `end_time`, `is_available`, `availability_date`

### 2. Frontend Redux Updates (`schedulingSlice.js`)

**Fixed `fetchAvailableTherapists.fulfilled` reducer:**
- Removed incorrect filtering logic that was trying to extract both therapists and drivers
- Now correctly handles the backend response that only contains therapists with availability data
- Changed from filtering response to directly storing: `state.availableTherapists = action.payload`

**Confirmed `fetchAvailableDrivers.fulfilled` reducer:**
- Already correctly implemented to handle driver-only responses
- Properly stores: `state.availableDrivers = action.payload`

### 3. Frontend Component Updates

**AppointmentForm.jsx:**
- ✅ `fetchAvailableDrivers` import already added
- ✅ Dispatch calls for both therapists and drivers already implemented
- ✅ Updated therapist dropdown to show availability times: `(Available: ${start_time}-${end_time})`
- ✅ Updated driver dropdown to show availability times: `(Available: ${start_time}-${end_time})`

**Calendar.jsx:**
- ✅ Already displayed therapist availability times
- ✅ Updated driver display to show availability times: `Available: ${start_time} to ${end_time}`

## Data Flow

### Before Fix:
1. Frontend calls API with date/time
2. Backend returns basic user info without availability details
3. Frontend shows therapists even if not available at requested time
4. No availability times shown to users

### After Fix:
1. Frontend calls API with date/time parameters
2. Backend filters by exact availability and returns only matching therapists/drivers
3. Response includes availability time windows
4. Frontend displays filtered results with availability times
5. Empty arrays returned when no one is available (instead of fallback data)

## Key Features Added

1. **Proper Availability Filtering**: Only therapists/drivers available at the exact requested time are returned
2. **Availability Time Display**: Users can see when each therapist/driver is available
3. **Better User Experience**: Clear indication when no one is available for selected time
4. **Accurate Data**: No more showing unavailable staff members

## Testing

The implementation can be tested using:
- The created test script: `test_availability_api.py`
- Manual testing through the UI by selecting different dates and times
- API endpoints can be tested directly:
  - `GET /api/scheduling/availabilities/available_therapists/?date=YYYY-MM-DD&start_time=HH:MM&end_time=HH:MM`
  - `GET /api/scheduling/availabilities/available_drivers/?date=YYYY-MM-DD&start_time=HH:MM&end_time=HH:MM`

## Expected Behavior

1. **When date/time/service selected**: Only available therapists/drivers shown with their availability windows
2. **When no availability**: Empty dropdowns with message "No available therapists/drivers for selected time"
3. **When date/time not selected**: Shows general staff members (fallback behavior)
4. **In development**: Fallback data available for testing when API fails

## Files Modified

- `guitara/scheduling/views.py` - Backend API endpoints
- `royal-care-frontend/src/features/scheduling/schedulingSlice.js` - Redux state management
- `royal-care-frontend/src/components/scheduling/AppointmentForm.jsx` - Form dropdowns
- `royal-care-frontend/src/components/scheduling/Calendar.jsx` - Availability display

The fix ensures that the scheduling system now properly filters therapist and driver availability based on the selected date and time, and provides users with clear visibility into when staff members are available.
