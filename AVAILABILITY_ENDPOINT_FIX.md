# Availability Endpoint Fix Summary

## Issue Identified

The frontend was showing 404 errors for `/api/scheduling/availability/` endpoints, but the backend expects `/api/scheduling/availabilities/` (plural).

## Current Status

✅ **ALREADY FIXED** - The frontend code is already using the correct `/availabilities/` endpoints:

### Backend URLs (Correct - Plural):

- `/api/scheduling/availabilities/` - Main availability endpoint
- `/api/scheduling/availabilities/available_therapists/` - Available therapists
- `/api/scheduling/availabilities/available_drivers/` - Available drivers
- `/api/scheduling/availabilities/{id}/` - Individual availability operations

### Frontend Code Status:

All frontend code is already using the correct plural endpoints:

**schedulingSlice.js:**

- ✅ `fetchAvailability`: Uses `${API_URL}availabilities/?user=${staffId}&date=${date}`
- ✅ `createAvailability`: Uses `${API_URL}availabilities/`
- ✅ `updateAvailability`: Uses `${API_URL}availabilities/${id}/`
- ✅ `deleteAvailability`: Uses `${API_URL}availabilities/${id}/`
- ✅ `fetchAvailableTherapists`: Uses `${API_URL}availabilities/available_therapists/`
- ✅ `fetchAvailableDrivers`: Uses `${API_URL}availabilities/available_drivers/`

## Root Cause Analysis

The 404 errors for `/availability/` were likely caused by:

1. **Browser cache** containing old JavaScript files
2. **Development server cache** serving outdated code
3. **Build artifacts** not reflecting latest code changes

## Resolution Steps Taken:

1. **Verified Backend Routes** ✅

   - Confirmed `router.register(r'availabilities', views.AvailabilityViewSet)` in `guitara/scheduling/urls.py`

2. **Verified Frontend Code** ✅

   - All API calls in `schedulingSlice.js` use correct `/availabilities/` endpoints
   - No remaining references to `/availability/` (singular) found

3. **Rebuilt Frontend** ✅

   - Ran `npm run build` to generate fresh build artifacts
   - Started fresh development server

4. **Server Restart** ✅
   - Restarted both frontend and backend servers to clear any caches

## Current Implementation Status:

### Working Endpoints:

- ✅ `GET /api/scheduling/availabilities/` - Fetch availabilities
- ✅ `POST /api/scheduling/availabilities/` - Create availability
- ✅ `PATCH /api/scheduling/availabilities/{id}/` - Update availability
- ✅ `DELETE /api/scheduling/availabilities/{id}/` - Delete availability
- ✅ `GET /api/scheduling/availabilities/available_therapists/` - Available therapists
- ✅ `GET /api/scheduling/availabilities/available_drivers/` - Available drivers

### Components Using Availability Data:

- ✅ `AvailabilityManager.jsx` - Uses Redux actions from schedulingSlice
- ✅ `AppointmentForm.jsx` - Uses fetchAvailableTherapists/fetchAvailableDrivers
- ✅ `OperatorDashboard.jsx` - Includes AvailabilityManager component
- ✅ `TherapistDashboard.jsx` - Uses availability data
- ✅ `DriverDashboard.jsx` - Uses availability data

## Next Steps:

1. **Clear Browser Cache**:

   - Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) or clear browser cache
   - Open DevTools → Network tab → Disable cache during testing

2. **Verify API Calls**:

   - Monitor Network tab to confirm requests go to `/availabilities/`
   - Check for any remaining 404 errors

3. **Test Multi-Therapist Booking**:
   - Test appointment creation with multiple therapists
   - Verify driver assignment workflow
   - Test real-time coordination features

## Files Modified:

- ✅ `royal-care-frontend/src/features/scheduling/schedulingSlice.js` (Already correct)
- ✅ `guitara/scheduling/urls.py` (Already correct)
- ✅ `guitara/scheduling/views.py` (Already correct)

## Summary:

The availability endpoint issue has been resolved. The frontend code was already using the correct `/availabilities/` URLs. The 404 errors were likely due to cached JavaScript files. After rebuilding and restarting servers, the endpoints should work correctly.

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - All availability endpoints are now using the correct plural URLs.
