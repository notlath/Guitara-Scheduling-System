# Calendar Client Labels Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented color-coded client labels on calendar days for TherapistDashboard and DriverDashboard calendars.

## Features Added

### 1. Calendar View in Dashboards
- âœ… Added "Calendar View" tab to TherapistDashboard
- âœ… Added "Calendar View" tab to DriverDashboard
- âœ… Both dashboards now have a dedicated Calendar component with `showClientLabels={true}`

### 2. Client Name Labels
- âœ… Client names display on calendar days when appointments exist
- âœ… Shows up to 2 client names per day
- âœ… Shows "+X more" indicator when more than 2 appointments exist
- âœ… Only visible in Therapist and Driver dashboards (controlled by `showClientLabels` prop)

### 3. Status-Based Color Coding
Client labels are color-coded based on appointment status:
- ðŸŸ  **Orange** (`#f59e0b`) - Pending appointments
- ðŸ”µ **Blue** (`#3b82f6`) - Confirmed appointments  
- ðŸŸ£ **Purple** (`#8b5cf6`) - Active/En Route appointments

- ðŸŸ¢ **Light Green** (`#22c55e`) - Completed appointments
- ðŸ”´ **Red** (`#ef4444`) - Cancelled appointments

### 4. Enhanced UX Features

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow:
- Calendar component gets appointments from Redux state (`state.scheduling.appointments`)
- Filters appointments by date for each calendar day
- Extracts client names and status information
- Applies appropriate color classes based on status

### Color Classification Logic:
```javascript
const getStatusColorClass = (status) => {
  switch (status) {
    case "pending": return "status-pending";
    case "confirmed": 
    case "therapist_confirmed":
    case "driver_confirmed": return "status-confirmed";
    case "in_progress":
    case "journey_started": 
    case "arrived": return "status-active";
    case "session_in_progress": return "status-session";
    case "completed":
    case "transport_completed": return "status-completed";
    case "cancelled": return "status-cancelled";
    default: return "status-default";
  }
};
```

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced Visibility**: Therapists and drivers can quickly see which clients have appointments on any given day
2. **Status Awareness**: Color coding provides immediate visual feedback about appointment status
3. **Improved Planning**: Easy to spot busy days and plan schedules accordingly
4. **User-Friendly**: Intuitive interface with helpful legends and tooltips

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
- Add client phone numbers in tooltips
- Support for drag-and-drop appointment rescheduling
- Integration with appointment filtering by status
- Export calendar view functionality
- Multiple client label display modes (compact vs. detailed)
