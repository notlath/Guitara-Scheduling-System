# Calendar Client Labels Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive color-coded client labels on calendar days for TherapistDashboard and DriverDashboard calendars with role-specific status workflows.

## Features Added

### 1. Calendar View in Dashboards

- âœ… Added "Calendar View" tab to TherapistDashboard with `context="therapist"`
- âœ… Added "Calendar View" tab to DriverDashboard with `context="driver"`
- âœ… Both dashboards now have a dedicated Calendar component with `showClientLabels={true}`
- âœ… Role-specific context enables appropriate status color mappings

### 2. Client Name Labels

- âœ… Client names display on calendar days when appointments exist
- âœ… Shows up to 2 client names per day
- âœ… Shows "+X more" indicator when more than 2 appointments exist
- âœ… Only visible in Therapist and Driver dashboards (controlled by `showClientLabels` prop)
- âœ… Interactive tooltips with client name and human-readable status

### 3. Role-Specific Status-Based Color Coding

#### Therapist Dashboard Colors (Session-Focused Workflow):

- ðŸŸ  **Pending** - Initial appointment states awaiting confirmation
  - `pending`, awaiting therapist response
- ðŸ”µ **Confirmed** - Appointment confirmed and ready to proceed
  - `confirmed`, `therapist_confirmed`, `driver_confirmed`
- ðŸŸ£ **Active/Transport** - Transport and coordination phases
  - `in_progress`, `journey`, `journey_started`, `arrived`, `pickup_requested`, `driver_assigned_pickup`, `return_journey`
- ðŸŸ¢ **Session/Treatment** - Treatment delivery phases
  - `dropped_off`, `session_in_progress`, `awaiting_payment`, `payment_requested`
- âœ… **Completed** - Finished appointments
  - `completed`, `payment_completed`, `transport_completed`
- ðŸ”´ **Cancelled/Rejected** - Terminated appointments
  - `cancelled`, `rejected`, `auto_cancelled`

#### Driver Dashboard Colors (Transport-Focused Workflow):

- ðŸŸ  **Pending/Awaiting Assignment** - Awaiting driver action or assignment
  - `pending`, `therapist_confirmed`, `pickup_requested`
- ðŸ”µ **Confirmed/Ready to Drive** - Driver confirmed and ready
  - `confirmed`, `driver_confirmed`
- ðŸŸ£ **Active Transport/Pickup** - All transport and pickup activities
  - `in_progress`, `journey`, `journey_started`, `driving_to_location`, `arrived`, `at_location`, `dropped_off`, `driver_assigned_pickup`, `return_journey`, `picking_up_therapists`, `transporting_group`, `therapist_dropped_off`
- âœ… **Transport Completed** - Transport cycle finished
  - `driver_transport_completed`, `transport_completed`, `completed`
- ðŸ”´ **Cancelled/Rejected** - Transport assignments terminated
  - `cancelled`, `rejected`

### 4. Enhanced UX Features

- âœ… Context-aware status legend explaining role-specific color meanings
- âœ… Tooltips showing client name and appointment status on hover
- âœ… Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
- âœ… Proper overflow handling for long client names

## Usage

### For Therapists:

1. Navigate to TherapistDashboard
2. Click "Calendar View" tab
3. View color-coded client labels on calendar days
4. Hover over labels to see detailed status information

### For Drivers:

1. Navigate to DriverDashboard
2. Click "Calendar View" tab
3. View color-coded client labels on calendar days
4. Use color legend to understand appointment statuses

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow:

- Calendar component gets appointments from Redux state (`state.scheduling.appointments`)
- Filters appointments by date for each calendar day
- Extracts client names and status information
- Applies appropriate color classes based on status

### Color Classification Logic:

```javascript
const getStatusColorClass = (status) => {
  switch (status) {
    case "pending":
      return "status-pending";
    case "confirmed":
    case "therapist_confirmed":
    case "driver_confirmed":
      return "status-confirmed";
    case "in_progress":
    case "journey_started":
    case "arrived":
      return "status-active";
    case "session_in_progress":
      return "status-session";
    case "completed":
    case "transport_completed":
      return "status-completed";
    case "cancelled":
      return "status-cancelled";
    default:
      return "status-default";
  }
};
```

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced Visibility**: Therapists and drivers can quickly see which clients have appointments on any given day
2. **Status Awareness**: Color coding provides immediate visual feedback about appointment status
3. **Improved Planning**: Easy to spot busy days and plan schedules accordingly
4. **User-Friendly**: Intuitive interface with helpful legends and tooltips

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

- Add client phone numbers in tooltips
- Support for drag-and-drop appointment rescheduling
- Integration with appointment filtering by status
- Export calendar view functionality
- Multiple client label display modes (compact vs. detailed)
