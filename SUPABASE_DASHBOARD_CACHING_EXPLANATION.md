# Supabase Dashboard Cache Solutions

## Method 1: Force Dashboard Refresh

1. In Supabase Dashboard, go to Storage > avatars
2. Press `Ctrl + F5` or `Cmd + Shift + R` (hard refresh)
3. Or open an incognito/private window
4. The thumbnail should now show the updated image

## Method 2: Clear Browser Cache

1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button → "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
3. Or go to Application tab → Storage → Clear storage

## Method 3: Use Different File Names (Optional)

If you want to avoid caching entirely, you could modify the storage path to include timestamps:

```python
# In storage_service.py (optional modification)
storage_path = f"users/{user_id}/profile_{timestamp}.{file_extension}"
```

But this would create multiple files instead of replacing, so I recommend keeping your current approach.

## Method 4: Verify via API

Use this curl command to verify the file is actually updated:

```bash
curl -I "https://your-project.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/avatars/users/123/profile.jpg"
```

Check the `Last-Modified` header to confirm the file timestamp.

## ✅ Conclusion

Your implementation is correct! The dashboard caching is a Supabase UI quirk, not a bug in your code.
The important thing is:

- ✅ Frontend shows updated image
- ✅ Get URL shows updated image
- ✅ Direct URL access shows updated image
- ⚠️ Dashboard thumbnail may be cached (cosmetic only)

This is completely normal behavior for web dashboards that cache thumbnails for performance.
