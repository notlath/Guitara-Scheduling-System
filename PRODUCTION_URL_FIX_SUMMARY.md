# Production URL Fix Summary

## Problem Fixed

The production build was making API calls to `http://localhost:8000` instead of the production server `https://charismatic-appreciation-production.up.railway.app`, causing:

- Connection refused errors
- Failed API requests
- Broken application functionality in production

## Root Cause

Multiple files had hardcoded `localhost:8000` URLs instead of using environment-based URL detection.

## Files Fixed

### 1. **NotificationsPage.jsx** ⭐ (Main cause of production errors)

- **Fixed**: 4 hardcoded API endpoints for notifications
- **Impact**: Notification system now works in production

### 2. **paginationHelpers.js** ⭐ (Critical for dashboard)

- **Fixed**: All 7 appointment endpoints (rejected, pending, timeout, etc.)
- **Impact**: Dashboard appointment views now work in production

### 3. **NotificationCenter.jsx**

- **Fixed**: 4 hardcoded notification API endpoints
- **Impact**: Notification center component works in production

### 4. **NotificationCenter_NEW.jsx**

- **Fixed**: 5 hardcoded notification API endpoints
- **Impact**: New notification center works in production

### 5. **NotificationDebugger.jsx**

- **Fixed**: 2 debug endpoint URLs
- **Impact**: Debug tools work in production

### 6. **webSocketTanStackService.js**

- **Fixed**: WebSocket URL from `ws://localhost:8000` to `wss://charismatic-appreciation-production.up.railway.app`
- **Impact**: Real-time updates work in production

## URL Pattern Applied

All fixed files now use this consistent pattern:

```javascript
const baseURL = import.meta.env.PROD
  ? "https://charismatic-appreciation-production.up.railway.app/api"
  : import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL || "http://localhost:8000/api";
```

For WebSocket:

```javascript
const wsUrl = import.meta.env.PROD
  ? "wss://charismatic-appreciation-production.up.railway.app/ws/scheduling/appointments/"
  : import.meta.env.VITE_WS_URL ||
    "ws://localhost:8000/ws/scheduling/appointments/";
```

## Testing Checklist

To verify the fixes work:

### Development (should still work)

- [ ] Notifications load
- [ ] Dashboard appointment tabs work
- [ ] Can mark notifications as read/unread
- [ ] WebSocket real-time updates work

### Production (should now work)

- [ ] No more `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` errors
- [ ] Dashboard loads appointment data
- [ ] Notifications page works
- [ ] Real-time updates work
- [ ] No console errors about localhost:8000

## Build and Deploy

1. **Build the frontend:**

   ```bash
   cd royal-care-frontend
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to production:**

   ```bash
   # Your deployment process here
   ```

3. **Test production deployment:**
   - Visit your production URL
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Test notification system
   - Test dashboard functionality

## Verification Commands

Run these to ensure no hardcoded localhost URLs remain:

```bash
# Check for any remaining hardcoded localhost URLs (should only show fallbacks)
grep -r "localhost:8000" royal-care-frontend/src/ --include="*.js" --include="*.jsx"

# Check for production URLs (should show environment-based logic)
grep -r "charismatic-appreciation" royal-care-frontend/src/ --include="*.js" --include="*.jsx"
```

## Expected Result

After these fixes, your production application should:

- ✅ Connect to the correct production API
- ✅ Load all dashboard data
- ✅ Display notifications properly
- ✅ Support real-time updates via WebSocket
- ✅ Show zero connection errors in browser console

## Files Still Using localhost:8000 (Expected)

These files still contain `localhost:8000` but only as fallback values in development, which is correct:

- All files with `|| "http://localhost:8000/api"` patterns
- These are proper fallbacks and won't be used in production
