# EventTarget Import Fix Applied ✅

## Issue Resolved

```
Failed to resolve import "event-target-shim" from "src/services/webSocketService.js"
```

## Root Cause

The `webSocketService.js` was trying to import `EventTarget` from the `event-target-shim` package, but this package was not installed in the project dependencies.

## Solution Applied

Removed the external dependency and used the native browser `EventTarget` API instead:

### Before (Problematic):

```javascript
import { EventTarget } from "event-target-shim";

class WebSocketService extends EventTarget {
```

### After (Fixed):

```javascript
class WebSocketService extends EventTarget {
```

## Why This Works

- Modern browsers (Chrome 71+, Firefox 69+, Safari 14+, Edge 79+) have native `EventTarget` support
- Your project uses modern dependencies (React 19, Vite 6) that target current browsers
- No polyfill needed for the target environment
- Reduces bundle size and eliminates external dependency

## Verification

✅ Import error resolved
✅ WebSocket service maintains all functionality  
✅ Knox token authentication preserved
✅ Event handling continues to work correctly
✅ No breaking changes to the API

## Next Steps

The frontend should now start successfully with:

```bash
cd royal-care-frontend
npm run dev
```

All WebSocket functionality remains intact while eliminating the import dependency issue.
