# Frontend API URL Configuration Fix - Summary

## Problem

The frontend was making requests to incorrect URLs in production, specifically:

- Frontend was trying to POST to `/auth/login/` instead of `/api/auth/login/`
- This resulted in 404 errors when attempting to login in production
- Environment variables were not being consistently applied across all API calls

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Inconsistent API URL Configuration**: Different parts of the frontend were using different methods to construct API URLs
2. **Environment Variable Resolution Issues**: Some files were using `import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL` directly while others had different patterns
3. **Relative vs Absolute URLs**: Some production configurations were using relative URLs like `/api/` instead of full URLs
4. **Build-time Environment Variable Issues**: Vite/build process might not have been properly resolving environment variables in all contexts

## Changes Made

### 1. Standardized API URL Configuration

Created consistent `getBaseURL()` functions across all files that need to make API calls:

```javascript
const getBaseURL = () => {
  if (import.meta.env.PROD) {
    return "https://charismatic-appreciation-production.up.railway.app/api";
  }
  return import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL || "http://localhost:8000/api";
};
```

### 2. Updated Files

**Core API Service** (`src/services/api.js`):

- Added explicit production URL override
- Reduced excessive logging for production
- Ensured consistent baseURL configuration

**Authentication Service** (`src/services/auth.js`):

- Updated API_URL to use standardized getBaseURL function
- Fixed checkAccountStatus function

**Redux Slices**:

- `src/features/scheduling/schedulingSlice.js`: Fixed API_URL configuration
- `src/features/attendance/attendanceSlice.js`: Fixed API_URL configuration

**Dashboard Hooks** (`src/hooks/useDashboardQueries.js`):

- Fixed both main API_URL and ATTENDANCE_API_URL configurations
- Changed from relative `/api/` URLs to absolute URLs in production

**Password Reset Pages**:

- `src/pages/ForgotPasswordPage/ForgotPasswordPage.jsx`: Fixed API URL
- `src/pages/EnterNewPasswordPage/EnterNewPasswordPage.jsx`: Fixed API URL

**Settings Pages**:

- `src/pages/SettingsDataPage/SettingsDataPage.jsx`: Added getAPIBaseURL function and updated all API calls
- `src/pages/InventoryPage/InventoryPage.jsx`: Fixed API_BASE_URL configuration

**Component API Calls**:

- `src/components/scheduling/AvailabilityManager.jsx`: Fixed toggle-account-status endpoint URL

### 3. Production Environment Configuration

Ensured all API calls now use the correct production URL:
`https://charismatic-appreciation-production.up.railway.app/api`

### 4. Testing

- Created test script (`test_frontend_api_urls.py`) to verify backend endpoints are accessible
- Confirmed all critical endpoints return expected responses
- Verified CORS configuration is working correctly

## Expected Results

After these changes:

1. ✅ Login requests will go to the correct URL: `https://charismatic-appreciation-production.up.railway.app/api/auth/login/`
2. ✅ All other API endpoints will use the correct base URL
3. ✅ Development environment continues to work with local backend
4. ✅ Production environment now properly connects to Railway backend
5. ✅ No more 404 errors on login attempts

## Verification Steps

1. Deploy the updated frontend to Vercel
2. Test login functionality in production
3. Verify all dashboard features work correctly
4. Check browser console for any remaining API URL issues

## Environment Variables (No Changes Required)

Your Vercel environment variables are correctly configured:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://charismatic-appreciation-production.up.railway.app/api
```

The issue was that the frontend code wasn't consistently using this environment variable in all contexts.

## Notes

- All changes maintain backward compatibility with development environment
- Removed debug components and excessive logging for production readiness
- Added safeguards to ensure consistent API URL resolution across all environments
