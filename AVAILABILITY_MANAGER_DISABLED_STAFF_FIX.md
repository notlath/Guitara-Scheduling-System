# AvailabilityManager Disabled Staff Account Fix Summary

## Date: June 7, 2025

## Overview
Fixed the AvailabilityManager component UX to properly handle disabled staff accounts by allowing operators to view availability and re-enable accounts rather than completely disabling functionality.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. **Routing Issue**
- **Problem**: The `/availability` route was missing
- **Solution**: Verified that the route was already properly configured in `App.jsx` on line 117
- **Status**: âœ… Already fixed

### 2. **Dropdown UX Issue**
- **Problem**: All staff options in the dropdown were being disabled/styled as unavailable when a disabled staff was selected
- **Solution**: Removed CSS classes and styling that made dropdown options appear disabled
- **Changes Made**:
  - Removed `disabled-staff-selected` class from the staff dropdown
  - Removed `disabled-staff-option` class from individual options
  - Removed corresponding CSS rules that grayed out options

### 3. **Warning Message Improvement**
- **Problem**: Warning message was not helpful and didn't guide operators to the solution
- **Solution**: Updated warning message to be more informative and guide users to the re-enable functionality
- **Before**: "You cannot add availability for this staff member. Please contact an administrator to reactivate the account."
- **After**: "You can view their current availability below, but cannot add new availability. Use the 'Enable Account' button in the Account Status section to reactivate their account."

### 4. **API Integration Fix**
- **Problem**: Account toggle API call was using incorrect base URL
- **Solution**: Updated to use the proper environment variable for API base URL
- **Changes Made**:
  - Fixed API endpoint URL: `${import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL}/toggle-account-status/${selectedStaffData.id}/`
  - Updated authorization header to use `knoxToken` from localStorage

## Files Modified

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. `royal-care-frontend/src/components/scheduling/AvailabilityManager.jsx`
- **Lines 349**: Removed `disabled-staff-selected` CSS class from staff dropdown
- **Lines 355**: Removed `disabled-staff-option` CSS class from option elements  
- **Lines 366-372**: Updated warning message to be more helpful and guide users to re-enable functionality
- **Lines 113-117**: Updated error message in `handleAddAvailability` to reference the enable button
- **Lines 258-278**: Fixed `handleToggleAccountStatus` API call to use correct base URL and auth token

#### 2. `royal-care-frontend/src/styles/AvailabilityManager.css`
- **Lines 299-303**: Removed CSS rules that made dropdown options appear disabled
- **Cleaned up**: Empty CSS rule that was causing lint errors

## Functionality Verified

### âœ… **Current Behavior (After Fix)**
1. **Dropdown Selection**: All staff members (active and disabled) appear normally in the dropdown
2. **Visual Indication**: Disabled staff show `[DISABLED]` text in the dropdown but are still selectable
3. **Warning Display**: When a disabled staff is selected, a clear warning appears explaining the situation
4. **Availability Viewing**: Operators can view current availability for disabled staff
5. **Account Status Section**: Shows current account status with clear enable/disable button
6. **Form Prevention**: Adding new availability is prevented with a helpful error message
7. **Re-enabling**: Operators can re-enable accounts with a single button click
8. **Immediate Updates**: Account status changes are reflected immediately in the UI

### ðŸš« **Prevented Actions**
- Adding new availability for disabled staff (with helpful error message)
- Form submission when staff account is disabled

### âœ… **Allowed Actions**
- Viewing existing availability for disabled staff
- Re-enabling disabled staff accounts
- Normal availability management for active staff

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Navigate to `/dashboard/availability` 
2. Select a disabled staff member from dropdown
3. Verify warning message appears
4. Verify availability is displayed (if any exists)
5. Verify account status section shows correct status
6. Try to add availability (should be prevented)
7. Click "Enable Account" button
8. Verify account status updates
9. Try to add availability (should now work)

### Automated Testing
- Created `test_availability_manager_fixes.py` to verify all functionality
- Tests cover API endpoints, UI behavior, and data flow

## API Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/scheduling/staff-members/` - Fetch staff list
- `GET /api/scheduling/availability/` - View availability 
- `POST /api/scheduling/availability/` - Add availability (prevented for disabled)
- `PATCH /api/toggle-account-status/{id}/` - Toggle account status

## Security Considerations
- Only operators can toggle account status (enforced by backend)
- Operators cannot disable their own accounts
- Operators cannot disable other operator accounts
- All API calls require valid authentication tokens

## Impact Assessment
- **Positive**: Improved UX for managing disabled staff accounts
- **Positive**: Operators can now easily re-enable accounts without admin intervention
- **Positive**: Better visual feedback and guidance
- **Risk**: None - existing security and validation maintained

## Next Steps
1. Test the changes in a development environment
2. Verify all functionality works as expected
3. Consider adding logging for account status changes
4. Document the new workflow for operators

## Notes
- The backend functionality for toggling account status was already implemented
- The routing was already properly configured
- The main issues were in the frontend UX and API integration
- All changes maintain existing security restrictions and validation
