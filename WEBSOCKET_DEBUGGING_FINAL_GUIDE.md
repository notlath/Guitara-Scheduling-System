# WebSocket Connection Issues - Comprehensive Fix Guide

## üö® ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### 1. WebSocket URL Connection Error

**Error**: `WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:8000/ws?token=...' failed:`
**Expected**: `ws://localhost:8000/ws/scheduling/appointments/?token=...`

### 2. Missing Function Error

**Error**: `TypeError: markPaymentPaidInstantly is not a function`
**Fixed**: ‚úÖ Added missing functions to `useInstantUpdates` hook

### 3. Notifications API Format Issue

**Error**: `‚ö†Ô∏è Notifications response is not an array, converting to empty array`
**Fixed**: ‚úÖ Updated `useDashboardQueries.js` to handle paginated responses

## üîß SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED

### ‚úÖ 1. Fixed Missing `markPaymentPaidInstantly` Function

Updated `royal-care-frontend/src/hooks/useInstantUpdates.js` to include:

- `updateAppointmentInstantly`
- `markPaymentPaidInstantly`
- `reviewRejectionInstantly`
- `autoCancelOverdueInstantly`

### ‚úÖ 2. Fixed Notifications API Response Handling

Updated `royal-care-frontend/src/hooks/useDashboardQueries.js` to properly handle:

- Paginated responses with `{count, results, next, previous}` structure
- Empty results arrays
- Various response formats

### ‚úÖ 3. Added WebSocket URL Debugging

Added detailed logging to `royal-care-frontend/src/services/webSocketTanStackService.js` to identify URL construction issues.

## üîç WEBSOCKET URL DEBUGGING

The WebSocket connection error suggests an environment variable issue. Here's how to diagnose:

### Environment Variable Priority (Vite):

1. `.env.local` (highest priority)
2. `.env.development`
3. `.env` (lowest priority)

### Current Configuration:

- `.env.local`: `VITE_WS_BASE_URL=wss://charismatic-appreciation-production.up.railway.app/ws/scheduling/appointments/`
- `.env`: `VITE_WS_BASE_URL=ws://localhost:8000/ws/scheduling/appointments/`

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS TO RESOLVE WEBSOCKET ISSUE

### Step 1: Clear Browser Cache and Rebuild

```bash
# Clear frontend cache and rebuild
cd royal-care-frontend
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
rm -rf dist
npm run build
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Verify Environment Variables

The WebSocket service now includes debug logging. Check browser console for:

```
üîç WebSocket Environment Debug: {
  PROD: false,
  DEV: true,
  MODE: "development",
  VITE_WS_BASE_URL: "ws://localhost:8000/ws/scheduling/appointments/"
}
üîó WebSocket URL constructed: ws://localhost:8000/ws/scheduling/appointments/
üîó Final WebSocket URL with auth: ws://localhost:8000/ws/scheduling/appointments/?token=...
```

### Step 3: Check Backend Server

Ensure Django backend is running with WebSocket support:

```bash
# Start Django backend
cd guitara
python manage.py runserver
```

### Step 4: Test WebSocket Connection

If URL is still incorrect, check for:

- Browser cache/service worker issues
- Module hot reload problems
- Environment variable loading issues

## üìã VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

### Frontend Fixes: ‚úÖ

- [x] `markPaymentPaidInstantly` function added
- [x] `updateAppointmentInstantly` function added
- [x] `reviewRejectionInstantly` function added
- [x] `autoCancelOverdueInstantly` function added
- [x] Notifications API response handling fixed
- [x] WebSocket URL debugging added

### Backend Status: ‚úÖ

- [x] WebSocket routing configured: `/ws/scheduling/appointments/`
- [x] Token authentication middleware working
- [x] ASGI application configured for WebSocket support

## üéØ EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER FIX

1. **No `markPaymentPaidInstantly` errors** - OperatorDashboard should work
2. **Proper notifications loading** - No array conversion warnings
3. **Correct WebSocket URL** - Should connect to full path with `/scheduling/appointments/`
4. **Real-time updates working** - All dashboards should sync in real-time

## üîß IF WEBSOCKET STILL FAILS

If WebSocket URL is still showing `ws://localhost:8000/ws` instead of the full path:

1. **Hard refresh browser** (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **Clear all browser data** for localhost:5173
3. **Restart development servers** (both frontend and backend)
4. **Check for service worker** caching issues
5. **Verify no old WebSocket service files** are being imported

The debug logging added to the WebSocket service will help identify exactly what URL is being constructed.
