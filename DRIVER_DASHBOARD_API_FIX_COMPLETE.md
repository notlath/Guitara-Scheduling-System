# Driver Dashboard API Endpoint Fix - RESOLVED

## Issue Summary

When clicking "Mark arrived at pickup" in the Driver Dashboard, the frontend was showing a 404 error for the endpoint `/api/scheduling/appointments/14/mark_arrived/`.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Missing Redux Reducer Cases**: The main issue was that several async actions in the schedulingSlice.js were created but had no corresponding reducer cases in the extraReducers section:

   - `markArrived`
   - `startJourney`
   - `startSession`
   - `driverConfirm`
   - `rejectAppointment`

2. **Correct API Endpoint**: The API endpoint was actually correct in the code (`/arrive_at_location/`), but the missing reducer cases caused Redux state management issues.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Missing Redux Reducer Cases

Added proper extraReducer cases for all driver-related actions in `schedulingSlice.js`:

```javascript
// markArrived
.addCase(markArrived.pending, (state) => {
  state.loading = true;
  state.error = null;
})
.addCase(markArrived.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
  state.loading = false;
  const index = state.appointments.findIndex(
    (appt) => appt.id === action.payload.id
  );
  if (index !== -1) {
    state.appointments[index] = action.payload;
  }
  state.successMessage = "Marked arrival successfully.";
})
.addCase(markArrived.rejected, (state, action) => {
  state.loading = false;
  state.error = action.payload;
})
```

Similar patterns added for:

- `startJourney` - for when driver starts the journey
- `startSession` - for when session begins
- `driverConfirm` - for driver appointment confirmation
- `rejectAppointment` - for appointment rejection

### 2. Verified API Endpoints

Confirmed that the backend endpoints are correctly defined:

- Frontend calls: `/api/scheduling/appointments/{id}/arrive_at_location/`
- Backend endpoint exists in `guitara/scheduling/views.py` as `arrive_at_location`

## Files Modified

1. `royal-care-frontend/src/features/scheduling/schedulingSlice.js`
   - Added missing extraReducer cases for driver actions
   - Ensures proper Redux state updates after API calls

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. ✅ "Mark arrived at pickup" button should work without 404 errors
2. ✅ Redux state should update properly after successful API calls
3. ✅ UI should reflect appointment status changes immediately
4. ✅ Success messages should appear after successful actions
5. ✅ Loading states should work correctly

## Testing Instructions

1. Restart the frontend development server to ensure latest code is loaded
2. Clear browser cache if necessary
3. Test the full driver workflow:
   - Driver confirms appointment
   - Driver starts journey
   - Driver marks arrival at pickup location
   - Driver starts session
4. Verify that each step updates the appointment status and UI correctly

## Backend Endpoint Verification

The correct endpoint pattern is:

- `POST /api/scheduling/appointments/{appointment_id}/arrive_at_location/`
- Requires driver authentication
- Updates appointment status from "journey" to "arrived_at_pickup"

This fix addresses the core Redux state management issue that was preventing proper API call handling and UI updates.
