## WEBSOCKET CONNECTION FIX - DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED FIXES

1. **Backend Authentication Fixed**

   - Fixed `TokenAuthMiddleware` string/bytes encoding issue
   - Backend now properly authenticates WebSocket connections
   - Verified with Python tests: WebSocket server works correctly

2. **Frontend Code Fixed**

   - Fixed WebSocket URL path: `/ws/scheduling/appointments/` (was `/ws/`)
   - Fixed token key: `knoxToken` instead of `authToken`
   - Fixed environment variable name: `VITE_WS_BASE_URL` consistently used
   - Updated all environment files with correct WebSocket paths

3. **Backend CORS Verified**
   - Railway backend correctly allows Vercel domain
   - All necessary CORS headers present
   - WebSocket upgrade requests properly supported

### üîÑ DEPLOYMENT REQUIRED

The fixes are complete in the code, but **Vercel needs to be updated**:

#### Required Actions:

1. **Update Vercel Environment Variables**

   ```
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://charismatic-appreciation-production.up.railway.app/api
   VITE_WS_BASE_URL=wss://charismatic-appreciation-production.up.railway.app/ws/scheduling/appointments/
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://cpxwkxtbjzgmjgxpheiw.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
   ```

2. **Redeploy Frontend to Vercel**

   - Trigger a new deployment to pick up code changes
   - Ensure environment variables are applied

3. **Clear Browser Cache**
   - Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) or incognito mode
   - Clear application storage if needed

### üß™ VERIFICATION STEPS

After deployment:

1. Open browser developer tools
2. Navigate to Vercel-deployed frontend
3. Check Console for WebSocket connection logs
4. Should see: `‚úÖ WebSocket connected successfully`
5. Network tab should show successful WebSocket connection

### üîß LOCAL TESTING

To test locally with the fixes:

```bash
cd royal-care-frontend
npm run dev
```

The local environment now uses the correct paths and should connect to Railway backend.

### üìù TECHNICAL SUMMARY

**Root Causes Fixed:**

- Path mismatch: Backend expects `/ws/scheduling/appointments/`, frontend was using `/ws/`
- Token key mismatch: Frontend was looking for `authToken`, should be `knoxToken`
- Environment variable inconsistency: `VITE_WS_URL` vs `VITE_WS_BASE_URL`
- Backend authentication: String/bytes encoding issue in Knox token processing

**Current Status:**

- ‚úÖ Backend works (verified with direct WebSocket tests)
- ‚úÖ Frontend code fixed
- ‚è≥ Deployment pending (Vercel environment + redeploy needed)
