# Material Usage System - Implementation Complete

## 🎯 **Overview**

Successfully implemented a comprehensive material usage tracking system for the Guitara Scheduling System that handles:

1. **Volume-based materials** (Oils, Lotions, Alcohol Spray) - partial deduction in ml
2. **Item-based materials** (Other categories) - whole unit deduction  
3. **Reusable equipment** (Ventosa Kits, Hot Stone Kits) - temporary reservation with automatic return

## 🏗️ **System Architecture**

### **Backend Components**

#### 1. **New Models**
- **`AppointmentMaterial`** - Tracks material usage per appointment
  - Links appointments to inventory items
  - Records quantity used, usage type (consumable/reusable)
  - Tracks deduction and return timestamps
  - Supports notes for audit trail

#### 2. **Material Usage Service** (`material_usage_service.py`)
- **`MaterialUsageService.deduct_materials_for_appointment()`**
  - Automatically determines material type (volume/item/reusable)
  - Deducts appropriate quantities from inventory
  - Creates usage tracking records
  - Generates usage logs

- **`MaterialUsageService.return_reusable_materials()`**
  - Returns reusable materials when appointment completes
  - Updates inventory stock levels
  - Marks materials as returned with timestamp
  - Creates return usage logs

- **`MaterialUsageService.get_appointment_material_summary()`**
  - Provides comprehensive usage summary for appointments

#### 3. **Enhanced Models**
- **`InventoryItem`** - Added helper methods:
  - `is_volume_based()` - Detects volume-based categories
  - `is_reusable()` - Detects reusable categories  
  - `get_effective_unit()` - Returns appropriate unit (ml vs original unit)

#### 4. **Signal Integration**
- **Automatic Material Return** - Django signal triggers when appointment status → 'completed'
- **Real-time Processing** - Materials returned immediately upon completion
- **Error Handling** - Graceful failure handling with logging

#### 5. **API Endpoints**
- **Appointment Creation** - Enhanced to accept materials data
- **Material Usage Tracking** - New endpoint for viewing appointment usage
- **Inventory Integration** - Usage data available in inventory views

### **Frontend Components**

#### 1. **Enhanced Appointment Form**
- **Smart Material Selection** - Different UX for different material types:
  - 🧴 **Volume-based**: Input in ml with step 0.1
  - 🔄 **Reusable**: Clear indication of return policy
  - 📦 **Item-based**: Standard unit input
- **Visual Indicators** - Color coding and badges for material types
- **Stock Validation** - Real-time stock checking
- **Usage Hints** - Contextual help for each material type

#### 2. **Enhanced Inventory Page**
- **Usage Tracking Button** - View appointment usage per item
- **Material Usage Modal** - Detailed usage history with:
  - Appointment details
  - Usage amounts and types
  - Return status for reusables
  - Material type indicators

## 🔄 **Material Workflow**

### **1. Appointment Creation**
```
User selects service → Materials loaded → User specifies quantities → Appointment created
                                                                           ↓
                                    Materials automatically deducted from inventory
                                                                           ↓
                                    AppointmentMaterial records created
                                                                           ↓
                                    Usage logs generated
```

### **2. Material Types Processing**

#### **Volume-Based Materials** (Oils, Lotions, Alcohol Spray)
- ✅ User inputs exact ml needed (e.g., 50ml massage oil)
- ✅ Only specified amount deducted from inventory  
- ✅ Bottle remains until fully consumed
- ✅ Precise usage tracking

#### **Reusable Materials** (Ventosa/Hot Stone Kits)
- ✅ 1 unit temporarily deducted when appointment created
- ✅ Material marked as 'reusable' with reservation timestamp
- ✅ Unit automatically returned when appointment completed
- ✅ No permanent inventory impact

#### **Item-Based Materials** (Other categories)
- ✅ Whole units deducted (e.g., 3 towels)
- ✅ Standard inventory decrementation
- ✅ Permanent deduction

### **3. Appointment Completion**
```
Appointment status → 'completed' → Signal triggered → Reusable materials returned
                                                                 ↓
                                              Inventory stock restored
                                                                 ↓
                                              Return timestamp recorded
                                                                 ↓
                                              Return usage log created
```
