## üöÄ Testing Instructions

### 1. **Check Console Logs**
Open browser developer tools and check console for:
```
üîç NotificationCenter: Component mounted, fetching notifications...
üë§ NotificationCenter: Current user info
üìä NotificationCenter: Current notification state
‚úÖ fetchNotifications: Success
```

### 2. **Test Different User Roles**
1. Login as Operator
2. Login as Therapist  
3. Login as Driver
4. Check if notifications appear for each role

### 3. **Test Three-Dot Menu**
1. Click the three-dot menu on any notification
2. Test "Mark as read/unread" functionality
3. Test "Delete" functionality
4. Verify menu closes when clicking outside

### 4. **Use Debug Component**
Add the NotificationDebugger component to any dashboard:
```jsx
import NotificationDebugger from './scheduling/NotificationDebugger';

// In component render:
<NotificationDebugger />
```

## üîß Potential Root Causes to Investigate

### 1. **Backend Issues**
- Notifications not being created for all user roles
- User authentication/authorization problems

- Redux state not updating correctly
- API endpoint configuration issues

### 3. **Data Issues**
- Missing user assignments in appointments
- Incomplete user role setup
- Notification filtering problems

- Consistent styling with overall theme
- Improved accessibility

### Better Error States
- Clear error messages with context
- Loading states for better UX
- Empty state messaging

## üìã Next Steps

1. **Test the enhanced logging** - Check browser console for debugging information
2. **Use the debug component** - Add NotificationDebugger to a dashboard for detailed diagnostics
3. **Check backend data** - Verify notifications are being created for all user roles
4. **Test role-based access** - Ensure each user role can see their notifications
5. **Monitor API responses** - Check if API is returning data correctly

## üéØ Expected Behavior

After these fixes:
- Notifications should display for all user roles (Operator, Therapist, Driver)
- UI should be consistent with theme.css variables
- Three-dot menu should work smoothly with mark read/unread and delete options
- Better error handling and debugging information should help identify any remaining issues
