#### 3. Service Flow Workflow

The complete workflow now supports:

```
1. BOOKING CREATION
   └── Operator creates appointment with therapist(s) and driver selection
   └── Support for carpooling and multi-therapist appointments

2. ACCEPTANCE PHASE
   └── Therapists accept/reject appointments
   └── Driver accepts transport assignments
   └── System tracks all acceptances before proceeding

3. CONFIRMATION PHASE  
   └── Therapists confirm readiness (therapist_confirmed)
   └── Driver confirms availability (driver_confirmed)
   └── Both confirmations required before journey

4. JOURNEY PHASE
   └── Driver starts journey (journey_started)
   └── Driver marks arrival at pickup (arrived)
   └── Real-time location tracking support

5. SESSION PHASE
   └── Therapist starts session (session_started)
   └── Session timing and progress tracking
   └── Payment request handling (payment_requested)
   └── Session completion (completed)

6. PICKUP PHASE
   └── Therapist requests pickup (pickup_requested)
   └── Support for normal/urgent pickup requests
   └── Automatic driver assignment for pickup
   └── Return journey coordination
```
