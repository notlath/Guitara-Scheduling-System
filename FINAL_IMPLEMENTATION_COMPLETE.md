## ✅ **COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATIONS**

### 1. **Advanced Sorting by Time and Urgency**

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**

- **Location:** `src/components/OperatorDashboard.jsx`

  - ✅ Intelligent urgency scoring (0-100 scale)
  - ✅ Time-based prioritization
  - ✅ Visual urgency indicators with color coding
  - ✅ Animated critical appointment alerts
  - ✅ Memoized performance optimization

**Urgency Priority System:**

```
🔴 Critical (90-100): Pending with <5min deadline, Active sessions
🟠 High (70-89): Confirmed starting <1hr, Overdue
🟡 Medium (40-69): Awaiting payment, Approaching deadline
🟢 Normal (0-39): Scheduled, Completed, Rejected
```

### 2. **Client-Side Pagination**

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**

- **Files Created:**

  - `src/hooks/usePagination.js` - Reusable pagination logic
  - `src/components/Pagination.jsx` - UI component

- **Features:**
  - ✅ Configurable items per page (default: 10)
  - ✅ Smart page navigation with ellipsis
  - ✅ Mobile-responsive design
  - ✅ Accessibility support (ARIA labels)
  - ✅ URL persistence for bookmarking

### 3. **"View Completed" Button & Advanced Filtering**

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**

### 4. **AppointmentForm Caching & Performance**

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**

- **Centralized Cache Hook:** `src/hooks/useAppointmentFormCache.js`
- **Components Created:**

  - `src/components/common/LazyClientSearch.jsx` - Lazy loading client search
  - `src/components/common/CachedTherapistSelect.jsx` - Availability-based caching
  - `src/components/common/CachedDriverSelect.jsx` - Time-based caching

- **Features:**
  - ✅ Lazy loading with infinite scroll for clients
  - ✅ Debounced search (300ms)
  - ✅ Smart caching with TTL
  - ✅ Availability-based therapist/driver caching
  - ✅ Memory optimization with cache limits
  - ✅ **INTEGRATED into AppointmentForm**
