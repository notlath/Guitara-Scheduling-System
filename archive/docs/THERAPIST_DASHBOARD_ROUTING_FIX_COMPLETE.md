# Therapist Dashboard Routing - Fix Implementation Complete

## 🎯 Problem Identified

The issue was that **therapists were being incorrectly redirected to `/dashboard/scheduling`** (SchedulingDashboard) instead of `/dashboard` (TherapistDashboard) in two scenarios:

1. **After login** - login components were redirecting to wrong route
2. **When clicking the Royal Care logo** - though this was actually working correctly

## ✅ Root Cause Analysis

- **TherapistDashboard.jsx** - Specific therapist dashboard component exists and is working correctly
- **App.jsx routing** - Correctly set up: `/dashboard` renders role-based dashboards
- **MainLayout.jsx logo** - Already correctly configured to redirect to `/dashboard`
- **Login components** - **INCORRECTLY** redirecting therapists to `/dashboard/scheduling`

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Login Redirect Logic

**File: `royal-care-frontend/src/pages/LoginPage/LoginPage.jsx`**

```javascript
// BEFORE (incorrect)
if (userRole === "operator") {
  return "/dashboard";
} else {
  return "/dashboard/scheduling"; // ❌ Wrong - sends therapists to scheduling
}

// AFTER (correct)
if (userRole === "operator") {
  return "/dashboard";
} else if (userRole === "therapist") {
  return "/dashboard"; // ✅ Correct - TherapistDashboard
} else if (userRole === "driver") {
  return "/dashboard"; // ✅ Correct - DriverDashboard
} else {
  return "/dashboard"; // Default fallback
}
```

**File: `royal-care-frontend/src/components/auth/Login.jsx`**

- Applied identical fix to login redirect logic

### 2. Verified Logo Click Logic (Already Correct)

**File: `royal-care-frontend/src/components/MainLayout.jsx`**

```javascript
// Logo click getDashboardRoute() function (already correct)
const getDashboardRoute = () => {
  switch (user.role) {
    case "operator":
      return "/dashboard"; // OperatorDashboard
    case "therapist":
      return "/dashboard"; // TherapistDashboard ✅
    case "driver":
      return "/dashboard"; // DriverDashboard
    default:
      return "/dashboard";
  }
};
```

## 📋 Dashboard Component Mapping

| User Role     | Route                   | Component             | Purpose                                    |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Operator**  | `/dashboard`            | `OperatorDashboard`   | Review rejections, timeouts, notifications |
| **Therapist** | `/dashboard`            | `TherapistDashboard`  | Accept/reject appointments, view schedule  |
| **Driver**    | `/dashboard`            | `DriverDashboard`     | Driver-specific dashboard                  |
| **All Roles** | `/dashboard/scheduling` | `SchedulingDashboard` | Booking management interface               |

## 🎯 Expected Behavior After Fix

### Therapist Login Flow:

1. **Therapist logs in** → Redirects to `/dashboard`
2. **App.jsx routing** → Renders `TherapistDashboard` component
3. **TherapistDashboard** → Shows therapist-specific interface (accept/reject appointments, etc.)

### Logo Click Flow:

1. **Therapist clicks Royal Care logo** → Navigates to `/dashboard`
2. **App.jsx routing** → Renders `TherapistDashboard` component
3. **Consistent experience** → Always lands on therapist-specific dashboard

### Access to Booking Management:

- **Therapists can still access** `/dashboard/scheduling` via navigation
- **Sidebar "Schedule" link** → Goes to `/dashboard/scheduling` (SchedulingDashboard)
- **This provides booking management** while keeping the main dashboard separate

## ✅ Testing Results

**Automated Tests: All PASS** ✅

- Operator login/logo → `/dashboard` ✅
- Therapist login/logo → `/dashboard` ✅
- Driver login/logo → `/dashboard` ✅

**Code Quality: All PASS** ✅

- No compile/lint errors ✅
- Proper routing structure ✅
- Component separation maintained ✅

## 🚀 Ready for Manual Testing

**To verify the fix:**

1. Start the app: `npm run dev` in `royal-care-frontend`
2. **Login as therapist** → Should see **TherapistDashboard**, not SchedulingDashboard
3. **Click Royal Care logo** → Should stay on **TherapistDashboard**
4. **Navigate to "Schedule"** → Should go to **SchedulingDashboard** for booking management

## 📁 Files Modified

1. `royal-care-frontend/src/pages/LoginPage/LoginPage.jsx` - Fixed therapist login redirect
2. `royal-care-frontend/src/components/auth/Login.jsx` - Fixed therapist login redirect
3. `archive/scripts/testing/test_logo_click_functionality.js` - Updated test to verify corrected behavior

## 🎉 Implementation Status: **COMPLETE**

**The therapist dashboard routing issue has been fully resolved.** Therapists will now be correctly redirected to their specific `TherapistDashboard` component both after login and when clicking the Royal Care logo, while still maintaining access to the scheduling interface when needed.
