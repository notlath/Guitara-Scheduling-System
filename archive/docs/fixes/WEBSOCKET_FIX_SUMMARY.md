# WebSocket Connection Fix Summary

## Issue

The frontend was attempting WebSocket connections to a non-existent backend WebSocket server, causing numerous connection failures and error messages in the console:

```
WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:8000/ws/scheduling/appointments/?token=...' failed: WebSocket is closed before the connection is established.
```

## Root Cause

Multiple dashboard components were still trying to establish WebSocket connections despite previous efforts to disable them:

- `SchedulingDashboard.jsx`
- `TherapistDashboard.jsx`
- `OperatorDashboard.jsx`

## Solution Applied

### 1. Disabled WebSocket Setup in All Dashboard Components

**Files Modified:**

- `src/components/scheduling/SchedulingDashboard.jsx`
- `src/components/TherapistDashboard.jsx`
- `src/components/OperatorDashboard.jsx`

**Changes:**

- Removed `setupWebSocket` calls
- Replaced with polling-only approach using `setInterval`
- Removed unused imports
- Cleaned up event handlers related to WebSocket status

### 2. Completely Disabled WebSocket Service

**File Modified:**

- `src/services/webSocketService.js`

**Changes:**

- Simplified the entire service to immediately return empty functions
- Disabled all WebSocket connection attempts at the service level
- All WebSocket functions now log that they are disabled and return early
- `setupWebSocket` returns an empty cleanup function
- Connection status always returns `false`

### 3. Polling Configuration

All dashboards now use polling for real-time updates:

- **TherapistDashboard**: 30-second intervals for silent background updates
- **SchedulingDashboard**: 20-second intervals for appointment refreshes
- **OperatorDashboard**: 20-second intervals for data refreshes

## Results

- ✅ No more WebSocket connection error messages
- ✅ Clean console output
- ✅ Dashboard functionality maintained through polling
- ✅ Non-intrusive background updates preserved
- ✅ All lint errors resolved

## Future Considerations

When the backend WebSocket server is implemented:

1. Call `enableWebSocketConnections()` to re-enable
2. Restore original WebSocket logic in the service
3. Update dashboard components to use WebSocket + polling fallback

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/scheduling/SchedulingDashboard.jsx`
2. `src/components/TherapistDashboard.jsx`
3. `src/components/OperatorDashboard.jsx`
4. `src/services/webSocketService.js`

All changes maintain backward compatibility and can be easily reverted when WebSocket backend support is added.
