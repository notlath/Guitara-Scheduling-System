## Reason for Archival

These Markdown files were moved to the archive because they are:

1. **Implementation documentation** - Detailed records of features that have been completed and integrated
2. **Fix summaries** - Documentation of specific issues that have been resolved
3. **Setup guides** - One-time setup instructions that are no longer needed for daily development
4. **Status reports** - Historical snapshots of project progress
5. **Troubleshooting records** - Reference material for past issues and their solutions

## Current Project State

After this cleanup, the project root directory now contains only essential files:

### Remaining in Root:

- `README.md` - Main project documentation (essential)
- `package.json` - Frontend dependencies
- `requirements.txt` - Backend dependencies
- Configuration files (`.gitignore`, etc.)

### Remaining in Subdirectories:

- `guitara/README.md` - Backend-specific documentation (essential)
- `royal-care-frontend/README.md` - Frontend-specific documentation (essential)

## Impact Assessment

- **Project Organization**: Significantly improved with clean root directory structure
- **Documentation Preservation**: All implementation and fix documentation preserved in archive with proper organization
- **Developer Experience**: Easier navigation with essential files remaining in root
- **Reference Access**: All historical documentation remains accessible in organized archive structure

## Recovery Instructions

If any of these documentation files are needed for reference:

1. All files are preserved in `archive/documentation/` with original content
2. Can be copied back to root directory if needed for active reference
3. All documentation remains valid and accurate for future troubleshooting

## Final State

The project now has a clean, organized structure with:

- ✅ All test scripts properly archived
- ✅ All implementation documentation archived
- ✅ All fix summaries archived
- ✅ Only essential project files in root directory
- ✅ Complete documentation preserved in archive
