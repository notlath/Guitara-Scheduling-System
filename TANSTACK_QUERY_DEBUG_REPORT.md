# TanStack Query Debug Report

## 🔍 Issue Analysis

Based on the Django backend logs and TanStack Query implementation:

### **Backend Status: ✅ WORKING**

- ✅ API endpoints responding (200 OK)
- ✅ 38KB of appointment data returned
- ✅ 144 database queries executed
- ✅ Authentication working (Token valid)

### **Frontend Issue: ❌ TanStack Query Not Displaying Data**

## 🚨 **Potential Root Causes**

### 1. **Redux Thunk Unwrapping Issue**

```javascript
// Current implementation may be failing here:
const result = await dispatch(fetchAppointments()).unwrap();
```

**Problem**: The `.unwrap()` might be throwing an error that's being caught and returning empty array.

### 2. **Query Key Caching Issue**

```javascript
// Query keys might be causing cache misses
queryKey: queryKeys.appointments.list, // ["appointments", "list"]
```

### 3. **Component Not Re-rendering**

The component might not be re-rendering when TanStack Query data changes.

## 🔧 **Debugging Steps Added**

1. **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed console logs to track data flow
2. **Error Handling**: Improved error catching in query functions
3. **State Debugging**: Added return data logging

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for the new debug logs:

   - `🔄 TanStack Query: Fetching appointments...`
   - `✅ TanStack Query: Appointments fetched successfully`
   - `🔍 useOperatorDashboardData return:`

2. **Verify Redux Thunk**: Ensure Redux thunks are working correctly
3. **Check Component Updates**: Verify component is re-rendering with new data

## 💡 **Quick Fix Options**

If issue persists, we can:

1. **Bypass Redux**: Call API directly in TanStack Query
2. **Use Legacy Hook**: Temporarily revert to useOptimizedDashboardData
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Mix TanStack Query with existing patterns

## 🚀 **Expected Resolution**

With the added debugging, we should be able to identify:

- ✅ If data is being fetched successfully
- ✅ If Redux thunk is working properly
- ✅ If component is receiving the data
- ✅ Where exactly the data flow is breaking

The issue is most likely in the Redux thunk unwrapping or component re-rendering.
