# Driver-Therapist Coordination Workflow Testing Guide

## üéØ Overview

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for testing the dynamic, efficient, and safety-focused driver-therapist coordination workflow implemented in the Guitara Scheduling Management System.

## üöÄ Starting the Development Environment

### Option 1: Using the Development Script (Recommended)

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd "C:\Users\USer\Downloads\Guitara-Scheduling-System"

# Run the development script (starts both backend and frontend)
python start_development.py
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Django Backend
cd "C:\Users\USer\Downloads\Guitara-Scheduling-System\guitara"
python manage.py runserver

# Terminal 2: Start React Frontend
cd "C:\Users\USer\Downloads\Guitara-Scheduling-System\royal-care-frontend"
npm run dev
```

## üìä Test Users & Roles

Ensure you have test users for each role:

- **Driver**: Tests transport coordination, pickup assignments, photo verification
- **Therapist**: Tests session completion, pickup requests, urgent pickup scenarios
- **Operator**: Tests driver assignment, coordination oversight, urgent response

## üß™ Core Workflow Test Scenarios

### 1. Single Therapist Transport Cycle

**Scenario**: Standard appointment with driver transport (Motorcycle)

**Steps**:

1. **Login as Operator** ‚Üí Create appointment with driver assignment
2. **Login as Driver** ‚Üí Accept appointment, start driving
3. **Driver**: Pick up therapist ‚Üí Mark "Therapist Picked Up"
4. **Driver**: Arrive at client location ‚Üí Mark "Arrived at Location"
5. **Driver**: Drop off therapist ‚Üí Mark "Therapist Dropped Off"
6. **Login as Therapist** ‚Üí Complete session ‚Üí Auto-request pickup
7. **Login as Operator** ‚Üí Assign available driver for pickup
8. **Login as Driver** ‚Üí Accept pickup assignment, complete transport

**Expected Results**:

- Real-time status updates across all dashboards
- Driver automatically becomes available after drop-off
- Pickup request triggers operator notifications
- Time-based estimation and zone proximity logic works
- Photo verification prompts appear (when implemented)

### 2. Group Therapist Transport (Car)

**Scenario**: Multiple therapists transported together

**Steps**:

1. **Operator**: Create appointment with multiple therapists + car driver
2. **Driver**: Accept group appointment
3. **Driver**: Start group pickup ‚Üí Collect all therapists
4. **Driver**: Mark "All Therapists Collected" ‚Üí Transport to location
5. **Driver**: Drop off group ‚Üí Mark "Group Dropped Off"
6. **Therapists**: Complete sessions ‚Üí Request individual pickups
7. **Operator**: Coordinate staggered pickup assignments

**Expected Results**:

- Group transport UI displays correctly
- Individual therapist tracking within group
- Staggered pickup coordination works
- Driver availability broadcast after group drop-off

### 3. Urgent Pickup Scenario

**Scenario**: Therapist needs immediate pickup

**Steps**:

1. **Therapist**: Complete session normally
2. **Therapist**: Click "Request Urgent Pickup"
3. **Operator**: Receive urgent notification
4. **Operator**: Auto-assign nearest available driver
5. **Driver**: Receive urgent pickup assignment
6. **Driver**: Accept and complete urgent pickup

**Expected Results**:

- Urgent notifications prominently displayed
- Automatic nearest driver assignment
- Priority handling in operator dashboard
- Real-time coordination updates

### 4. Dynamic Driver Reassignment

**Scenario**: Driver becomes available and gets reassigned

**Steps**:

1. **Driver A**: Complete drop-off ‚Üí Broadcast availability
2. **Therapist B**: (Different appointment) Request pickup
3. **Operator**: See Driver A in available drivers list
4. **Operator**: Assign Driver A to Therapist B pickup
5. **Driver A**: Accept new assignment immediately

**Expected Results**:

- Driver appears in available pool after drop-off
- Zone-based proximity calculation works
- Time estimation for pickup assignment
- Seamless reassignment workflow

### 5. Manual Status Updates & Coordination

**Scenario**: Testing non-GPS manual coordination

**Steps**:

1. **Driver**: Use manual status updates for each stage
2. **Operator**: Monitor time-based estimates vs actual times
3. **Test**: Zone-based proximity calculations
4. **Test**: Manual location confirmations
5. **Test**: Photo verification workflow (if enabled)

**Expected Results**:

- Manual status updates work reliably
- Time estimates are reasonable (zone-based)
- Operator can track progress without GPS
- Photo verification integrates smoothly

## üîß Technical Integration Tests

### 1. Real-Time Synchronization

- **Test**: Status changes propagate across all open dashboards
- **Check**: SyncService broadcasts work correctly
- **Verify**: No data conflicts or race conditions

### 2. Redux State Management

- **Test**: All async thunks execute successfully
- **Check**: State updates are consistent
- **Verify**: Error handling works properly

### 3. Error Handling & Recovery

- **Test**: Network failures and retry logic
- **Check**: Authentication expiry handling
- **Verify**: Graceful degradation when services unavailable

### 4. Performance & Responsiveness

- **Test**: Dashboard loading times
- **Check**: Polling intervals are appropriate
- **Verify**: Background updates don't disrupt UX

## üö® Critical Test Cases

### Safety & Verification

1. **Photo Verification**: Test upload and verification workflow
2. **Status Confirmations**: Ensure all critical status changes are recorded
3. **Time Tracking**: Verify session times and transport duration logging

### Coordination Edge Cases

1. **No Available Drivers**: Test urgent pickup when no drivers available
2. **Driver Cancellation**: Test driver canceling mid-transport
3. **Therapist No-Show**: Test handling therapist not at pickup location
4. **Simultaneous Requests**: Test multiple urgent pickups simultaneously

### Data Consistency

1. **Cross-Dashboard Sync**: Verify data consistency across all dashboards
2. **Status Conflicts**: Test handling conflicting status updates
3. **Session Cleanup**: Ensure sessions complete properly in all scenarios
