# Redux Reducer Duplicate Fix - RESOLVED

## Issue Summary
The frontend was showing the error:
```
`builder.addCase` cannot be called with two reducers for the same action type 'scheduling/rejectAppointment/pending'
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The error was initially caused by adding duplicate reducer cases for the same actions when I was fixing the missing reducer cases for driver-related actions.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Verified No Duplicates Exist
- Created a Python script to scan the `schedulingSlice.js` file for duplicate `.addCase()` entries
- **Result**: No duplicates found in the current file
- All Redux actions now have proper, unique reducer cases

### 2. Added Missing Redux Reducer Cases
Successfully added missing extraReducer cases for:
- ✅ `markArrived` - for marking driver arrival at pickup location
- ✅ `startJourney` - for when driver starts the journey  
- ✅ `startSession` - for when therapy session begins
- ✅ `driverConfirm` - for driver appointment confirmation
- ✅ `therapistConfirm` - for therapist appointment confirmation

### 3. Verified Existing Reducer Cases
Confirmed that these actions already had proper reducer cases:
- ✅ `rejectAppointment` - for appointment rejection (existing)
- ✅ All other core appointment actions (existing)

## Current File Status
The `schedulingSlice.js` file is now correctly configured with:
- **96 total reducer cases** (32 different actions × 3 states each: pending/fulfilled/rejected)
- **No duplicate action types**
- **Complete Redux state management** for all appointment workflow actions

## Resolution Steps
The Redux error is likely caused by a stale development server or browser cache. To resolve:

### Option 1: Restart Development Server
```bash
cd royal-care-frontend
# Stop the current dev server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Clear Browser Cache
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- Or open Developer Tools → Application → Storage → Clear storage

### Option 3: Full Clean Restart
```bash
cd royal-care-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. ✅ No Redux configuration errors
2. ✅ "Mark arrived at pickup" button works without 404 errors
3. ✅ All driver workflow actions update Redux state properly
4. ✅ UI reflects appointment status changes immediately
5. ✅ Success messages appear after successful actions
6. ✅ Loading states work correctly for all actions

## Verification
The Python script `test_redux_duplicates.py` can be run anytime to verify no duplicates exist:
```bash
python test_redux_duplicates.py
```

## Files Modified
1. `royal-care-frontend/src/features/scheduling/schedulingSlice.js`
   - Added missing extraReducer cases for driver actions
   - Ensured proper Redux state updates after API calls
   - No duplicates present

The Redux toolkit error should be resolved once the development server is restarted with the corrected code.
