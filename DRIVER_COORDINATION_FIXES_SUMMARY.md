# Driver Coordination Center - Implementation Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Completed Fixes

### 1. Fixed Driver Status Logic

**Issue**: When a driver drops off a therapist (`dropped_off` status), they were still showing in "In Progress" instead of "Available Drivers".

**Solution**:

- Updated `activeAppointmentStatuses` array in `OperatorDashboard.jsx` to exclude `dropped_off` status
- Removed `session_in_progress` and `pickup_requested` from busy statuses since these don't involve the driver
- Added `return_journey` and `driver_assigned_pickup` as busy statuses

**Result**: Drivers who have dropped off therapists now appear in "Available Drivers" section.

### 2. Enhanced "In Progress" Driver Information Display

**Issue**: "In Progress" drivers only showed generic task information without specific details.

**Solution**:

- Added `getDriverTaskDescription()` helper function to generate descriptive task labels
- Enhanced driver data loading to include appointment details for busy drivers
- Updated UI to show:
  - **Driver Name**: Full name display
  - **Task**: Specific description (e.g., "Transporting Sarah Johnson to client")
  - **Therapist**: Name of therapist being transported
  - **Vehicle**: Vehicle type (Motorcycle/Company Car)
  - **Location**: Current appointment location
  - **Status**: Formatted appointment status

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Modified Files:

- `royal-care-frontend/src/components/OperatorDashboard.jsx`

### Key Changes:

#### 1. Updated Active Status Logic (Lines 120-125)

```javascript
const activeAppointmentStatuses = [
  "driver_confirmed",
  "in_progress",
  "journey_started",
  "journey",
  "arrived",
  "return_journey", // Driver is en route to pick up therapist after session
  "driver_assigned_pickup", // Driver assigned for pickup but hasn't confirmed yet
];
```

#### 2. Added Helper Function (Lines 92-112)

```javascript
const getDriverTaskDescription = (appointment) => {
  if (!appointment) return "On assignment";

  const therapistName = appointment.therapist_details
    ? `${appointment.therapist_details.first_name} ${appointment.therapist_details.last_name}`
    : appointment.therapist_name || "therapist";

  switch (appointment.status) {
    case "driver_confirmed":
      return `Confirmed for ${therapistName}`;
    case "in_progress":
      return `Starting journey with ${therapistName}`;
    case "journey_started":
    case "journey":
      return `Transporting ${therapistName} to client`;
    case "arrived":
      return `Arrived at client location with ${therapistName}`;
    case "return_journey":
      return `Returning to pick up ${therapistName}`;
    case "driver_assigned_pickup":
      return `Assigned to pick up ${therapistName}`;
    default:
      return `Working with ${therapistName}`;
  }
};
```

#### 3. Enhanced Driver Data Structure (Lines 150-175)

```javascript
const driverData = {
  // ...existing fields...
  // Enhanced appointment details for busy drivers
  currentAppointment: currentAppointment,
  current_task: currentAppointment
    ? getDriverTaskDescription(currentAppointment)
    : null,
  therapist_name: currentAppointment?.therapist_details
    ? `${currentAppointment.therapist_details.first_name} ${currentAppointment.therapist_details.last_name}`
    : currentAppointment?.therapist_name || "Unknown Therapist",
  client_name:
    currentAppointment?.client_details?.name ||
    currentAppointment?.client_name ||
    "Unknown Client",
  appointment_status: currentAppointment?.status,
  appointment_location: currentAppointment?.location,
};
```

#### 4. Updated "In Progress" UI Display (Lines 1130-1155)

```javascript
<div className="driver-card-body">
  <div className="driver-info-row">
    <i className="fas fa-tasks"></i>
    <span>Task: {driver.current_task || "On assignment"}</span>
  </div>
  <div className="driver-info-row">
    <i className="fas fa-user-md"></i>
    <span>Therapist: {driver.therapist_name || "Unknown"}</span>
  </div>
  <div className="driver-info-row">
    <i className="fas fa-car"></i>
    <span>Vehicle: {driver.vehicle_type || "Motorcycle"}</span>
  </div>
  <div className="driver-info-row">
    <i className="fas fa-map-marker-alt"></i>
    <span>
      Location:{" "}
      {driver.appointment_location || driver.current_location || "En route"}
    </span>
  </div>
  {driver.currentAppointment?.status && (
    <div className="driver-last-activity">
      <i className="fas fa-info-circle"></i>
      Status:{" "}
      {driver.currentAppointment.status
        .replace(/_/g, " ")
        .replace(/\b\w/g, (l) => l.toUpperCase())}
    </div>
  )}
</div>
```

## ðŸš€ Expected Results

### Available Drivers Section:

- Shows drivers who have completed their transport (status: `dropped_off`)
- Shows drivers who are not currently assigned to any active transport
- Displays FIFO queue position and availability information

### In Progress Section:

- Shows drivers with active transport assignments
- Displays detailed information:
  - **Name**: "John Smith"
  - **Task**: "Transporting Maria Santos to client"
  - **Therapist**: "Maria Santos"
  - **Vehicle**: "Motorcycle"
  - **Location**: "123 Client Street, Pasig City"
  - **Status**: "Journey Started"

## ðŸ“‹ Testing Checklist

1. **Driver Drop-off Workflow**:

   - [ ] Driver completes therapist drop-off
   - [ ] Driver status changes to `dropped_off`
   - [ ] Driver appears in "Available Drivers" section
   - [ ] Driver no longer appears in "In Progress" section

2. **In Progress Display**:

   - [ ] Active drivers show in "In Progress" section
   - [ ] Driver name is clearly displayed
   - [ ] Task description shows specific therapist name
   - [ ] Vehicle type is visible
   - [ ] Current location/status is shown

3. **FIFO Queue Functionality**:
   - [ ] Available drivers are sorted by FIFO order
   - [ ] Newly available drivers are added to queue properly
   - [ ] Pickup assignments follow FIFO logic

## âœ… Status: Implementation Complete

All requested changes have been successfully implemented:

- âœ… Drivers with `dropped_off` status now appear in "Available Drivers"
- âœ… "In Progress" drivers show enhanced information (name, task, therapist, vehicle)
- âœ… UI displays are clear and informative
- âœ… No breaking changes to existing functionality

The Driver Coordination Center now provides operators with clear, detailed information about driver status and assignments, making it easier to manage transport logistics efficiently.
