# Enhanced Dual Acceptance Workflow Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides a comprehensive solution to ensure that appointments can only proceed through status transitions (Pending → Confirmed → In Progress → Completed) if **both the Therapist and Driver have explicitly accepted** the appointment. This prevents conflicts and ensures clear workflow enforcement.

## Problem Solved

**Original Issue**: The system needed robust enforcement to prevent appointments from advancing when only one party has accepted, avoiding conflicts where one party rejects while the other party hasn't responded yet.

**Enhanced Solution**:

- Strict backend validation with detailed error messages
- Enhanced operator dashboard with dedicated acceptance tracking view
- Improved therapist and driver dashboards with clear acceptance status
- Visual indicators and blocking of invalid actions

## Implementation Details

### 1. Backend Enhancements

#### A. Enhanced Status Transition Validation

**File**: `guitara/scheduling/views.py`

Added `update_status` endpoint with strict validation:

```python
@action(detail=True, methods=["post"])
def update_status(self, request, pk=None):
    """Update appointment status with strict dual acceptance validation"""
    # Validates status transitions and enforces dual acceptance
    if new_status in ["confirmed", "in_progress"]:
        if not appointment.both_parties_accepted():
            pending_parties = appointment.get_pending_acceptances()
            return Response({
                "error": f"Cannot proceed to {new_status}. Both parties must accept first.",
                "pending_acceptances": pending_parties,
                "both_accepted": False
            }, status=400)
```

**Key Features**:

- Validates transition rules (pending → confirmed → in_progress → completed)
- Enforces dual acceptance for critical transitions
- Role-based permissions (only therapist can start, etc.)
- Detailed error messages with pending party information
- WebSocket notifications for real-time updates

#### B. Enhanced Acceptance Endpoint

The existing `accept` endpoint already handles:

- Individual party acceptance tracking
- Automatic status transition to "confirmed" only when both parties accept
- Partial acceptance notifications
- WebSocket updates for real-time sync

#### C. Enhanced Rejection Handling

**File**: `guitara/scheduling/views.py`

The `reject` endpoint includes:

- Automatic reset of acceptance flags when anyone rejects
- Proper rejection tracking with role identification
- Notification system for operators

### 2. Frontend Enhancements

#### A. Enhanced Operator Dashboard

**File**: `royal-care-frontend/src/components/OperatorDashboard.jsx`

**New Features**:

1. **Dedicated Pending Acceptance View**: New tab specifically for tracking acceptance status
2. **Enhanced Acceptance Status Display**: Clear visual indicators for each party's acceptance
3. **Blocked Actions**: Prevents manual confirmation until both parties accept
4. **Real-time Status Updates**: Shows acceptance timestamps and pending parties

**Key Components**:

```jsx
const renderPendingAcceptanceAppointments = () => {
  // Shows detailed acceptance status for each appointment
  // Visual grid showing therapist and driver acceptance status
  // Blocks confirmation until both parties accept
  // Shows timestamps for acceptance events
};
```

**Visual Enhancements**:

- ✓ Green checkmarks for accepted parties
- ⏳ Warning icons for pending parties
- Color-coded status indicators (green for ready, yellow for waiting)
- Disabled buttons with clear explanations when requirements not met

#### B. Enhanced Therapist Dashboard

**File**: `royal-care-frontend/src/components/TherapistDashboard.jsx`

**Existing Features** (already implemented):

- Shows "Start Session" button only when both parties have accepted
- Displays warning message when waiting for driver acceptance
- Visual indicators for pending acceptances

#### C. Enhanced Driver Dashboard

**File**: `royal-care-frontend/src/components/DriverDashboard.jsx`

**New Enhancements**:

- Added dual acceptance validation for "confirmed" status
- Shows warning when waiting for all parties to accept
- Blocks "Start Driving" until both parties have accepted

### 3. Enhanced Styling

**File**: `royal-care-frontend/src/styles/OperatorDashboard.css`

**New CSS Classes**:

- `.dual-acceptance-status`: Container for acceptance status display
- `.acceptance-grid`: Grid layout for showing both parties' status
- `.acceptance-item.accepted/.pending`: Status-specific styling
- `.overall-status.ready/.waiting`: Overall status indicators
- `.warning-status`: Warning messages for blocked actions
- `.acceptance-indicator`: Inline status indicators

## Workflow Enforcement Rules

### 1. Status Transition Rules

```
Pending → Confirmed: Requires both therapist AND driver acceptance
Confirmed → In Progress: Requires both parties accepted (already confirmed)
In Progress → Completed: Normal completion process
```

### 2. Role-Based Permissions

- **Therapist**: Can accept/reject assignments, start sessions when confirmed
- **Driver**: Can accept/reject assignments, start driving when confirmed
- **Operator**: Can review rejections, manually confirm when both parties accepted

### 3. Conflict Prevention

- **Rejection Reset**: When anyone rejects, all acceptance flags are reset
- **Partial Acceptance**: System shows which party is still pending
- **Visual Blocking**: UI prevents invalid actions with clear explanations
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket ensures all dashboards stay synchronized

## User Experience Improvements

### 1. Operator Dashboard

- **Clear Status Overview**: Dedicated view for pending acceptances
- **Action Blocking**: Cannot confirm appointments until both parties accept
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded status with timestamps
- **Conflict Resolution**: Clear indication when appointments are blocked and why

### 2. Therapist/Driver Dashboards

- **Acceptance Visibility**: Shows other party's acceptance status
- **Blocked Actions**: Cannot start work until all parties have accepted
- **Clear Messaging**: Explains why actions are blocked
- **Real-time Updates**: Status changes immediately when other party accepts/rejects

### 3. Notifications and WebSocket Updates

- **Real-time Sync**: All dashboards update immediately when status changes
- **Detailed Notifications**: Shows who accepted/rejected and when
- **Operator Alerts**: Notified when rejections need review
- **Progress Tracking**: Clear timeline of acceptance events

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. Normal Flow

1. Appointment created (pending)
2. Therapist accepts → Partial acceptance notification
3. Driver accepts → Automatically transitions to confirmed
4. Either party can now start their work

### 2. Rejection Handling

1. Appointment created (pending)
2. Therapist accepts → Partial acceptance
3. Driver rejects → Status becomes rejected, therapist acceptance reset
4. Operator reviews rejection

### 3. Conflict Prevention

1. Appointment created (pending)
2. Therapist accepts → Partial acceptance
3. Operator tries to manually confirm → Blocked with error message
4. System waits for driver acceptance

### 4. Edge Cases

1. **Mixed Rejections**: One accepts, other rejects → All flags reset
2. **Timeout Handling**: Overdue appointments can be auto-cancelled
3. **Manual Override**: Operators can only confirm when both accepted
4. **Real-time Sync**: Multiple users see consistent state

## Benefits

1. **Conflict Prevention**: Eliminates scenarios where work begins without full team acceptance
2. **Clear Communication**: Everyone knows exactly who has/hasn't accepted
3. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of acceptance/rejection events with timestamps
4. **User-Friendly**: Clear visual indicators and helpful error messages
5. **Real-time Coordination**: Immediate updates across all dashboards
6. **Operator Control**: Enhanced oversight with detailed status tracking
