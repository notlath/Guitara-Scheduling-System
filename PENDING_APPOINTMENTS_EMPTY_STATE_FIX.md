# 🔧 Pending Acceptance Appointments Empty State Fix

## Issue

The pending acceptance appointments view was not correctly showing the empty state when there were no appointments, due to flawed data source logic.

## Root Cause

The `renderPendingAcceptanceAppointments` function had the same issue as the rejected appointments function - it was using incorrect logic to determine which data to use:

**Before (❌ BROKEN):**

```javascript
const renderPendingAcceptanceAppointments = () => {
  const pendingAppointments =
    currentView === "pending" && Array.isArray(tabData) ? tabData : [];
  // This would return [] when currentView !== "pending"
  // even if there was pending appointment data available
```

## Solution Applied

**File:** `royal-care-frontend/src/components/OperatorDashboard.jsx`

**After (✅ FIXED):**

```javascript
const renderPendingAcceptanceAppointments = () => {
  // ✅ FIXED: Use pending appointments query data directly
  const pendingAppointments = pendingAppointmentsQuery.data
    ? Array.isArray(pendingAppointmentsQuery.data)
      ? pendingAppointmentsQuery.data
      : pendingAppointmentsQuery.data?.results || []
    : [];

  if (!pendingAppointments || pendingAppointments.length === 0) {
    return (
      <div className="empty-state">
        <i className="fas fa-clock"></i>
        <p>No appointments pending acceptance</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
  // ... rest of the function
```

## Expected Behavior

Now when users navigate to the "Pending Acceptance" tab:

1. **If there are pending appointments**: Shows the list of pending appointments with appropriate action buttons
2. **If there are no pending appointments**: Shows the exact empty state message as requested:
   ```html
   <h2>Pending Acceptance Appointments</h2>
   <div class="empty-state">
     <i class="fas fa-clock"></i>
     <p>No appointments pending acceptance</p>
   </div>
   ```

## Display Structure

The complete display structure for the pending acceptance view is:

```jsx
{
  currentView === "pending" && (
    <div className="pending-appointments">
      <h2>Pending Acceptance Appointments</h2>
      {renderPendingAcceptanceAppointments()}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Where `renderPendingAcceptanceAppointments()` will return either:

- The list of pending appointments, or
- The empty state with clock icon and message

## Benefits

- ✅ **Consistent data source**: Uses the same query (`pendingAppointmentsQuery`) for both data and empty state logic
- ✅ **Proper empty state display**: Shows the specific message with the clock icon as requested
- ✅ **Reliable condition**: No longer depends on `currentView` logic that could cause incorrect empty states
- ✅ **Better user experience**: Clear feedback when there are no appointments pending acceptance
- ✅ **Operator-specific context**: The heading and message clearly indicate this is for operator-confirmed actions

## Impact

This fix ensures that operators will see a clear, consistent message when there are no appointments requiring their acceptance, improving the user experience and reducing confusion about whether the system is working correctly.

## Notes

This fix follows the same pattern as the rejected appointments empty state fix, ensuring consistency across all appointment view types in the OperatorDashboard.
