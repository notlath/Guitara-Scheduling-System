# Enhanced Appointment Card Implementation

## Overview

This document details the implementation of enhanced appointment cards in the Guitara Scheduling System, providing comprehensive appointment details with improved UX.

## Backend Changes

### 1. Enhanced AppointmentSerializer

**File:** `guitara/scheduling/serializers.py`

**New Fields Added:**

- `formatted_date` - Human-readable date format (e.g., "December 25, 2024")
- `formatted_start_time` - Human-readable start time (e.g., "2:30 PM")
- `formatted_end_time` - Human-readable end time (e.g., "4:00 PM")
- `urgency_level` - Calculated urgency based on status and time until appointment

**Existing Serialized Fields:**

- `client_details` - Full client information including name, phone, address
- `therapist_details` - Single therapist information
- `therapists_details` - Multiple therapists information
- `driver_details` - Driver information including motorcycle plate
- `services_details` - Complete service information with pricing and duration
- `total_price` - Calculated total price from all services
- `total_duration` - Calculated total duration in minutes
- `both_parties_accepted` - Boolean indicating if both therapist and driver accepted
- `pending_acceptances` - List of parties that still need to accept

### 2. Optimized Queryset

**File:** `guitara/scheduling/views.py`

The AppointmentViewSet uses optimized queryset with proper prefetching:

```python
base_queryset = Appointment.objects.select_related(
    "client", "therapist", "driver", "operator", "rejected_by"
).prefetch_related("services", "therapists", "rejection_details")
```

## Frontend Changes

### 1. Enhanced Card Rendering

**File:** `royal-care-frontend/src/components/OperatorDashboard.jsx`

**Updated `renderAllAppointments` function to display:**

- Appointment ID for easy reference
- Client name and contact information
- Formatted date and time display
- Complete therapist information (single or multiple)
- Driver information with motorcycle plate
- Detailed services list with individual pricing and duration
- Total price and duration calculations
- Acceptance status indicators
- Urgency level indicators
- Additional notes and location details

### 2. Enhanced Styling

**File:** `royal-care-frontend/src/styles/EnhancedAppointmentCards.css`

**Features:**

- Modern card design with hover effects
- Color-coded status badges
- Responsive grid layout
- Organized information sections with background colors:
  - Client info: Light gray background
  - Services info: Light green background
  - Therapist info: Light orange background

## Data Flow

### 1. Backend API Response Structure

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 123,
      "client_details": {
        "first_name": "John",
        "last_name": "Doe",
        "phone_number": "+1234567890",
        "address": "123 Main St"
      },
      "therapist_details": {
        "first_name": "Jane",
        "last_name": "Smith",
        "specialization": "Deep Tissue",
        "massage_pressure": "medium"
      },
      "driver_details": {
        "first_name": "Mike",
        "last_name": "Johnson",
        "motorcycle_plate": "ABC123"
      },
      "services_details": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "Swedish Massage",
          "price": "150.00",
          "duration": 3600
        }
      ],
      "formatted_date": "December 25, 2024",
      "formatted_start_time": "2:30 PM",
      "formatted_end_time": "4:00 PM",
      "total_price": "150.00",
      "total_duration": 60,
      "urgency_level": "medium",
      "status": "confirmed"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Frontend Field Mapping

- `appointment.client_details?.first_name` - Client name
- `appointment.therapist_details` or `appointment.therapists_details` - Therapist info
- `appointment.services_details` - Services array
- `appointment.formatted_date` - Display date
- `appointment.urgency_level` - Priority indicator

## Urgency Level Calculation

The backend calculates urgency based on:

1. **Appointment Status**
2. **Time Until Appointment**

### Urgency Levels:

- **Critical** - In progress, session started, journey started
- **High** - Pending/confirmed appointments within 1-2 hours
- **Medium** - Awaiting payment, pending/confirmed within 2-4 hours
- **Normal** - All other appointments

## UI Components

1. **Header** - Client name and status badge
2. **Basic Info** - ID, date, time, location

5. **Driver Info** - Name and motorcycle plate
6. **Services Info** - Detailed services with pricing (light green background)
7. **Status Indicators** - Acceptance status and urgency level
8. **Actions** - Status-specific action buttons

### 2. Status Badge Colors

- **Pending** - Yellow/amber
- **Confirmed** - Green
- **Driver Confirmed** - Light blue
- **In Progress** - Blue
- **Awaiting Payment** - Light red
- **Completed** - Green
- **Rejected** - Red

### 3. Responsive Design
