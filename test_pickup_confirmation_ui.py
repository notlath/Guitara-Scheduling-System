Driver Dashboard Pickup Confirmation UI Testing Script

This script verifies that the enhanced pickup confirmation UI works correctly:
1. Driver receives clear pickup assignment with therapist details
2. UI emphasizes therapist being picked up with session completion timestamp
3. Shows pickup location (client's location) and therapist phone number
4. Displays 15-minute countdown timer
5. Disables all other actions except pickup confirmation
6. Shows prominent banner for active pickup assignments

Run this after implementing the frontend changes to verify functionality.
