      <h2>History and Background</h2>
      <p>
        Royal Care was established in 2010 as a family-run business, inspired by
        the founder, <strong>Jose Mc Rosval Basalatan</strong>. Drawing from his
        own positive experiences with home-service massage therapy, Jose
        recognized the unique convenience it offered clients and the untapped
        potential in the market. Motivated by a vision to make wellness more
        accessible, he began by recruiting trusted acquaintances as the first
        massage therapists, ensuring a personal touch and high standards from
        the very start.
      </p>
      <p>
        What began as a modest venture relying on word-of-mouth and traditional
        advertising (tarpaulins) quickly evolved as the business embraced
        digital marketing, particularly through Facebook. This strategic pivot
        became a key milestone in the company's growth, allowing Royal Care to
        reach a broader audience and establish itself as a trusted name in
        home-based wellness services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past 15 years, Royal Care has grown from a small family
        operation to a comprehensive massage therapy service provider. Today,
        the company operates from its Pasig location with a dedicated team of 28
        skilled therapists, 7 professional drivers, and 3 experienced operators,
        continuing to deliver premium massage services to clients who prefer the
        comfort and privacy of their own homes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The company has successfully completed over 50,000 sessions, maintaining
        a 98% customer satisfaction rate while continuously innovating its
        service delivery through technology and process improvements.
