# 🏠 Royal Care Scheduling System - Import/Export Error Resolution

✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED SUCCESSFULLY**

The console error about missing exports has been completely fixed:

```
DriverDashboard.jsx:6 Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '/src/features/scheduling/schedulingSlice.js' does not provide an export named 'acceptAppointment'
```

## 🔧 Root Cause Analysis

The issue was not specifically with `acceptAppointment` but with multiple missing async thunk functions that were being imported but not exported from `schedulingSlice.js`.
