🔧 INFINITE LOOP FIX VERIFICATION TEST
=====================================

The following fixes have been implemented:

✅ 1. DRIVER DATA LOADING EFFECT FIX:
   - Added initialDriverDataLoaded ref to prevent multiple loads
   - Use useCallback for loadDriverData function 
   - Use appointmentsLength instead of full appointments array
   - Use useCallback for getDriverTaskDescription

✅ 2. REDUX SELECTOR OPTIMIZATION:
   - Improved equality check in useOptimizedData
   - Added early return for same reference
   - Compare primitive values first for performance

✅ 3. TIMER EFFECT FIX:
   - Removed dummy state update that was forcing re-renders
   - Let countdown hooks handle their own updates

✅ 4. DATA TYPES STABILIZATION:
   - Improved stableDataTypes memoization
   - Better options object memoization in useOptimizedDashboardData

✅ 5. DEBUG MONITORING:
   - Added comprehensive debug logging
   - Render count tracking with warning at 50+ renders
   - Data state change tracking
   - Filtering trigger tracking

🧪 MANUAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:
==============================

1. Start the development server:
   npm run dev

2. Open browser console and navigate to Operator Dashboard

3. Look for these debug patterns:

   ✅ GOOD SIGNS:
   - "🔄 OperatorDashboard render #X" increments slowly (1-5 renders)
   - "🚗 Loading initial driver data" appears only once
   - "🔍 OperatorDashboard Debug - Data State:" logs appear occasionally
   - No "🚨 HIGH RENDER COUNT DETECTED" errors

   ❌ BAD SIGNS (indicates loop still exists):
   - Render count increases rapidly (10+ per second)
   - "🚗 Driver data effect triggered" repeats rapidly
   - "🔄 Filtering triggered" repeats rapidly
   - Browser becomes unresponsive

4. Test different tab switches in the dashboard to ensure stability

5. Monitor for ~30 seconds to ensure no sustained loops

🔍 DEBUGGING NEXT STEPS (if loop persists):
==========================================

If infinite loop still occurs, check these areas:

1. Redux state updates causing appointment array recreation
2. URL search params causing navigation loops  
3. Sync service event handlers triggering updates
4. Pagination state ping-ponging
5. Optimized data manager subscription issues

The debug logs will help identify which specific hook is causing the loop.
