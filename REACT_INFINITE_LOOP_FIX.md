# React Infinite Loop Fix Summary

## Problem

The app was experiencing "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors causing infinite re-renders. This was happening because of circular dependencies in React useEffect hooks.

## Root Cause

The issue was in multiple dashboard components where useCallback-memoized functions were being used as dependencies in useEffect hooks, which created circular dependency chains:

1. **SchedulingDashboard.jsx**: `refreshAppointments` function had `pollingInterval` state in its dependencies, and the useEffect that managed polling depended on `refreshAppointments`
2. **TherapistDashboard.jsx**: `refreshAppointments` function had `isInitialLoad` and `view` state in its dependencies, and multiple useEffect hooks depended on `refreshAppointments`
3. **OperatorDashboard.jsx**: Similar pattern with `refreshData` function

## Solution Applied

### SchedulingDashboard.jsx

- Removed the `pollingInterval` state tracking
- Simplified the polling useEffect to call dispatch actions directly
- Removed circular dependencies by not depending on the memoized function

### TherapistDashboard.jsx

- Removed `isInitialLoad` from `refreshAppointments` dependencies
- Restructured the initial load useEffect to call dispatch actions directly
- Added proper cleanup with mounted flag pattern
- Fixed dependency arrays to avoid circular references

### OperatorDashboard.jsx

- Modified polling useEffect to call dispatch actions directly instead of depending on `refreshData`
- Maintained the `refreshData` function for manual refresh actions

## Key Changes Made

1. **Eliminated circular dependencies**: Removed state variables from useCallback dependency arrays when those same variables were managed by useEffect hooks that depended on the callback
2. **Direct dispatch calls**: Used dispatch actions directly in polling intervals instead of depending on memoized functions
3. **Proper cleanup**: Added mounted flags and proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
4. **Simplified dependency arrays**: Reduced dependencies to only essential ones (primarily `dispatch`)

## Files Modified

- `/src/components/scheduling/SchedulingDashboard.jsx`
- `/src/components/TherapistDashboard.jsx`
- `/src/components/OperatorDashboard.jsx`

## Testing

After applying these fixes, the "Maximum update depth exceeded" error should be resolved and the app should run without infinite re-render loops while maintaining all functionality including:

- Background polling for appointment updates
- Initial data loading
- View-specific data refreshing
- Manual refresh capabilities

The dashboard components now have clean, non-circular dependency patterns that follow React best practices.
