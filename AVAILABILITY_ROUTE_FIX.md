# Availability Route Navigation Fix Summary

## Issue Identified

The `/availability` route was causing "No routes matched location" errors when navigating from the OperatorDashboard. The issue was identified as an incorrect navigation path in the "Manage Availability" button.

## Root Cause

- **Problem**: OperatorDashboard was using `navigate("/availability")` (absolute path)
- **Error**: This tried to navigate to the root `/availability` route
- **Reality**: The route is nested under `/dashboard`, so the full path is `/dashboard/availability`

## Route Structure Analysis

The React Router configuration in `App.jsx` shows:

```jsx
<Route
  path="/dashboard"
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute>
      <MainLayout />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  }
>
  {/* ... other routes ... */}
  <Route path="availability" element={<AvailabilityManager />} />
  {/* ... other routes ... */}
</Route>
```

This creates the full path: `/dashboard/availability`

## Fix Applied

**File Changed**: `royal-care-frontend/src/components/OperatorDashboard.jsx`

**Before**:

```jsx
<button
  className="availability-button"
  onClick={() => navigate("/availability")}
>
  Manage Availability
</button>
```

**After**:

```jsx
<button
  className="availability-button"
  onClick={() => navigate("availability")}
>
  Manage Availability
</button>
```

## Technical Details

- **Solution**: Changed from absolute path `"/availability"` to relative path `"availability"`
- **Context**: When inside the `/dashboard` route, relative navigation to `"availability"` resolves to `/dashboard/availability`
- **Alternative**: Could also use absolute path `"/dashboard/availability"`, but relative is cleaner

## Verification Results

✅ **Route Configuration**: Availability route properly configured in App.jsx  
✅ **Navigation Path**: OperatorDashboard now uses correct relative navigation  
✅ **Component Exists**: AvailabilityManager component exists and is imported  
✅ **Build Success**: Frontend builds without errors

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Navigation**: Clicking "Manage Availability" in OperatorDashboard navigates to `/dashboard/availability`
2. **Component Loading**: AvailabilityManager component loads properly
3. **No Errors**: No more "No routes matched location" errors
4. **URL Display**: Browser URL shows `/dashboard/availability`

## Testing Instructions

1. Start the frontend: `cd royal-care-frontend && npm run dev`
2. Login as an operator account
3. Navigate to the operator dashboard
4. Click the "Manage Availability" button
5. Verify that:
   - URL changes to `/dashboard/availability`
   - AvailabilityManager component loads
   - No console errors appear

## Files Modified

- `royal-care-frontend/src/components/OperatorDashboard.jsx` - Fixed navigation path
- `test_availability_route_fix.py` - Created test script for verification

## Implementation Status

✅ **COMPLETED** - The availability route navigation fix has been successfully implemented and verified.

The routing issue has been resolved and the "/availability" route should now work correctly when accessed from the OperatorDashboard.
